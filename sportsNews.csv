July 16, 2021 1:18:27 pmSarfaraz Ahmed and former head coach Mickey Arthur had combined well to take Pakistan to the ICC Champions Trophy title in 2017.",https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif,https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/pakistan-mistake-sarfaraz-arthur-removal-in-2019-rashid-latif-7407515/,"Former Test captain and wicketkeeper Rashid Latif believes Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has made a big mistake by removing Sarfaraz Ahmed and Mickey Arthur as skipper and coach of the national team after the 2019 World Cup.“Why was Mickey Arthur removed…what was the reason for his sacking? The team had done well under him and it was progressing well. Check the records and you can see but he was removed because of politics,” Latif said on the YouTube Cricket Baaz channel.He said Sarfaraz also didn’t deserve to be booted out.PCB had sacked Arthur one month after Pakistan failed to reach the semi-finals of the World Cup because of their net run rate, while Sarfaraz was removed as captain of all three formats after the national team suffered a whitewash against a weak Sri Lankan side in a T20 series at home in October-November 2019.Sarfaraz and Arthur had combined well to take Pakistan to the Champions Trophy title in 2017.“I don’t blame Misbah-ul Haq, perhaps he didn’t want to be head coach. He was young and inexperienced as a coach so why appoint him? It is the PCB to be blamed for what has happened,” Latif said.He after Sarfaraz and Arthur’s removal, the team had undergone changes which had not worked well for Pakistan cricket.“Today we have lost to a second string England team badly in the One-Day series which means that our cricket is not good enough to even beat England’s bench strength.”Latif hoped Pakistan can bounce back in the T20 series against England, starting on Friday, after being whitewashed 0-3 by the hosts in the ODI rubber.“Let’s just hope they can bounce back because we can’t afford anymore setbacks.”"

5,"‘Naomi Osaka’ docuseries takes intimate look at tennis star
 July 16, 2021  10:04:09 amThe three-part series debuting Friday is a contemplative, intimate look at a young athlete finding her way.",https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif,https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/tennis/naomi-osaka-docuseries-takes-intimate-look-at-tennis-star-7407222/,"Those looking for definitive answers about Naomi Osaka and how she copes with the demands of her career and fame shouldn’t expect to find them in a new Netflix docuseries about the four-time Grand Slam champion.It’s the tennis star’s unresolved questions that are the heart of “Naomi Osaka,” director-producer Garrett Bradley said of the series that was taped over a two-year period starting with the 2019 U.S. Open. Production concluded in early 2021 before Osaka’s withdrawal from the French Open.The three-part series debuting Friday is a contemplative, intimate look at a young athlete finding her way.Film of major tournaments, wins and losses, is interwoven with scenes of Osaka’s time with family and her boyfriend, the rapper Cordae; her training and business demands; Osaka’s reflections on her career, multiracial identity and the death of mentor Kobe Bryant, and her decision to protest police killings of Black men and women.“It was really important for me to not go into the project with an agenda or really even with an opinion,” Bradley, a 2021 Oscar nominee for the documentary “Time,” said.“I really tried to open myself up to her world and where she was at, and tried to understand the sort of essence of who she was.”As filming progressed, she said, it became clear that the series’ foundation would be the conundrums faced not only by Osaka but society at large.Those inquiries are “connected to value systems and self-definition, and how one can create a more holistic understanding of themselves in any given environment that they find themselves in,” said Bradley, whose fellow producers include LeBron James, under the umbrella of his SpringHill production company.Osaka, 23, who was not made available for an interview, withdrew from the French Open last May, citing “huge waves of anxiety” before speaking to the media and revealing that she has suffered long bouts of depression.She also skipped the just-ended Wimbledon, with her agent saying she wanted personal time, but is expected to compete in the upcoming Tokyo Olympics for her native Japan. Osaka was just a few years old when she, her sister and their Japanese mother and Haitian father moved to the United States.In a Time magazine essay published July 8, Osaka wrote that, “Believe it or not, I am naturally introverted and do not court the spotlight. I always try to push myself to speak up for what I believe to be right, but that often comes at a cost of great anxiety.”“I do hope that people can relate and understand it’s O.K. to not be O.K., and it’s O.K. to talk about it. There are people who can help, and there is usually light at the end of any tunnel,” she said, thanking Michelle Obama, Michael Phelps and other public figures for offering support.The Netflix docuseries includes footage of Osaka and her sister, Mari, on the court as youngsters, with the tennis star recalling spending at least eight hours a day at practice, adding, “I was just tired.”Mari Osaka, 25, also played professional tennis but said in a social media post in March that she was retiring from the sport because it was “a journey which I didn’t enjoy ultimately.” The docuseries sketches a portrait of Naomi Osaka as thoughtful and driven to succeed but struggling to cope with her sport’s demands and her future.At one moment of self-reflection she says, “So what am I, if not a good tennis player?”Filmmaker Bradley cautions that the series should not be seen as definitive, but rather a snapshot of a brief period in a life that continues to “evolve and grow.”“This moment that we captured was her in the process of a learning curve, which I think she directly articulates really beautifully, (that) there are elements of fame that are hard to be prepared for,” Bradley said.I first teamed up with @Barbie in 2019 and today we’re introducing the Barbie Role Model Naomi Osaka doll. I hope every child is reminded that they can be and do anything: https://t.co/GrPuW1WkMnFun fact : (the doll is wearing my outfit from the 2020 Australian Open lol) pic.twitter.com/DlL98lNfQj— NaomiOsaka大坂なおみ (@naomiosaka) July 12, 2021“The sustenance that she finds is in accepting where she is currently in this moment, and certainly in her family and in her loved ones, but also is in finding her own voice. And that includes choosing when to use it and when not to.”Asked how she perceived Osaka’s emotional well-being, Bradley said she considers her “an incredibly strong and really brilliant person.”“She’s in control of her own narrative, and I think that’s a beautiful thing,” she said."
6,"Why are there more successful older golfers today?
 July 16, 2021  9:02:19 amA decade ago, the idea of an older golfer contending in, let alone winning, a major championship was something few considered. That was still the time when most golfers petered out in their mid-40s and kicked around the golf world before having a brief resurgence on the Champions Tour when they turned 50.",https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif,https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/golf/why-are-there-more-successful-older-golfers-today-7407119/,"By Paul SullivanFrom the 18th fairway in the final group of the British Open in 2009, Tom Watson, the five-time Open champion, hit a shot that flew right at the pin. For a moment, it looked like Watson, then age 59, would win the tournament for a record sixth time and become the oldest player to win a major championship.A firm bounce sent the ball off the back of the green, and Watson needed three more shots to get the ball into the hole. That dropped him into a tie for first. In the four-hole playoff, he ran out of gas and lost by six shots.A decade ago, the idea of an older golfer contending in, let alone winning, a major championship was something few considered. That was still the time when most golfers petered out in their mid-40s and kicked around the golf world before having a brief resurgence on the Champions Tour when they turned 50.The man who beat Watson that day, Stewart Cink, is now part of a group of professional golfers defying age and expectation to contend and win tournaments and majors. Cink, 48, has won twice this season on the PGA Tour, his first wins since the 2009 Open.Leading these middle-age mavericks is Phil Mickelson, who, about to turn 51, won the PGA Championship in May. He beat Brooks Koepka, a four-time major winner, and Louis Oosthuizen, the 2010 British Open champion, who are both in their 30s.The group also includes Lee Westwood, 48, who won his third Race to Dubai in 2020. He then finished second to Bryson DeChambeau at the Arnold Palmer Invitational and runner-up the next week at the Players Championship to Justin Thomas.At last month’s U.S. Open, Richard Bland, 48, of England, became the oldest person to ever lead that tournament at the halfway mark. He had also been the oldest first-time winner on the European Tour, when he won the Betfred British Masters in May.“All these guys have taken a new approach,” said Dave Phillips, co-founder of the Titleist Performance Institute, which focuses on golf and fitness. “There’s a lot of money out there. They realize they can still compete with the younger guys, but they need to spend more time on their body and what they fuel their body with.”Phillips, who trains Jon Rahm, the 26-year-old winner of this year’s U.S. Open, has for years been part of Mickelson’s training team.Cink, who is in the field this week at Royal St. George’s, said his two wins this season could not be attributed to any one thing. “Being 47, 48, just doesn’t feel like I thought it might feel when I was 28,” he said. “My heart and mind make me feel like I’m 10, 15 years younger.”He credits club technology, but also the fitness regimen that players who came up with Tiger Woods embraced to compete against him.Westwood said he had always worked on being fit, and it has paid off. But he also knows his limits.“Everyone talks about how far Bryson hits it, and he hits it miles,” Westwood said. “If you’re younger you might try to keep up with him. At 47, 48, you’re wiser and more knowledgeable. I couldn’t keep up with him if I wanted to. But I can hit it first and closer to the pin and put a bit of pressure on him.”Mickelson has been very public about his training regimen, including how he hits “bombs” — his term for the very long drives he hits past younger players. But he is also making better decisions on the course, Phillips said, like his strategic play in winning the PGA Championship this year. (His caddie is his brother, Tim.)Phillips said what Mickelson and the others were doing provided lessons for older golfers. “It’s not strength, but the recovery and the downtime that matter,” he said. “It’s letting your body recover. Everyone wants to get fitter, stronger, faster. They’re upset when they don’t see the results. But what they’re doing is fatiguing to the body more so than a round of golf.”Crucial for older players? Maintain leg strength, Phillips said, and that means walk, don’t ride, when you play golf.“There’s no doubt when I came out on tour in 1996 generally you were thought to retire from professional golf in your mid-30s and take a club professional job,” said Padraig Harrington, 49, winner of three majors and the European captain for the Ryder Cup this year. “Then more money came into the game. And now there is no job that would pay you as well as being on tour.”Of course, earning money and winning are very different things, he said. When the players he competed with in their prime win today, he attributes it to their ability to focus on that moment.“One of the big things you see with Phil, myself, Lee Westwood is when we’re not in contention it’s tough,” he said. “When we do get into contention, we get back into it. We’re much better when we’re in contention than when we’re in that gray zone. Sunday when there’s a bit of energy, we get going.”"

This happened during a segment when all five members of the brand’s team in the women’s traditional tag-team match at the Survivor Series, came together in the same ring.

9,"No reinforcements to be sent despite Covid cases: BCCI
 July 16, 2021  12:48:58 pmThe BCCI allowed the Indian squad members to leave the bubble after the World Test Championship final that ended on June 23. Now the Indian contingent is taking Lateral Flow Test “on a daily basis to mitigate any further risks”.",https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif,https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/no-additions-allowed-despite-covid-cases-says-bcci-7406812/,"The Covid scare notwithstanding, the BCCI is not sending any additional player to England, The Indian Express has learnt.The Indian squad is off to Durham after a three-week break and the assembled party doesn’t have a wicketkeeper, with Rishabh Pant quarantining after testing positive on July 8 and Wriddhiman Saha in self-isolation in London as training assistant Dayanand Garani’s close contact. The latter tested positive for Covid on Wednesday and has been isolating at the team hotel in London.The BCCI, however, believes that with Pant being asymptomatic and nearing the completion of his quarantine period, at least as of now there’s no need to add players to an already bloated squad. “No,” said a top BCCI official when asked if any additional player would be sent to England.The selection committee picked a 20-member squad for the five-Test series in England, with an eye to pandemic-induced restrictions. India is still on the United Kingdom’s red list due to the Covid-19 surge, meaning stricter travel restrictions and more elaborate virus safety protocols. Accordingly, a 20-member squad plus four standbys were picked to provide adequate backup for almost every position in case of injuries or any other emergency.In Australia also last winter, India had to dig deep into their resources following injuries to several first-choice cricketers and backup players like Shardul Thakur, Washington Sundar and T Natarajan were drafted into the squad, and they played a major part in a memorable Test series win.The UK has been facing the spread of the Delta variant of the virus and although the entire Indian contingent, along with the travelling family members, was administered the second jab of the Covid vaccine earlier this month in London, visiting crowded places during the three-week break ran a risk. Pant and Jasprit Bumrah were spotted at a heavily-crowded Wembley, watching Euro 2020 matches. Head coach Ravi Shastri dropped in at Wimbledon.“Pant, who had not stayed in the team hotel during the break period, tested positive on 8th July. He is asymptomatic and currently undergoing self-isolation at the place where he reported positive. He is being closely monitored by the BCCI Medical Team and is on his way to recovery. He will be able to join the squad in Durham after returning two negative RT-PCR tests,” said the BCCI press release.And apart from Saha, bowling coach Bharat Arun and standby opener Abhimanyu Easwaran, too, are self-isolating for 10 days in London for being throwdown specialist Garani’s close contacts. It needs to be seen if Easwaran is drafted into the main squad, for Shubman Gill is nursing a leg injury. The Punjab opener, though, hasn’t been ruled out of the series.Asked if Easwaran will get in, a BCCI official said: “This is a call to be taken by the selectors and the team management. The BCCI doesn’t interfere in selection matters.”The BCCI allowed the Indian squad members to leave the bubble after the World Test Championship final that ended on June 23. Now the Indian contingent is taking Lateral Flow Test “on a daily basis to mitigate any further risks”.The Indian team left for England on June 3 and this 104-day tour is the longest the current lot have ever been to. The first Test against England in Nottingham commences on August 4, while the fifth Test in Manchester finishes on September 14. Ahead of the series, India will play a three-day warm-up game from Tuesday against a County XI."
10,"Covid scare for Team India: Rishabh Pant among two positive
 July 16, 2021  9:41:59 amWhile Pant has been under quarantine for over a week at a relative’s house, Garani has been isolated at a London hotel where the entire squad had checked in earlier this week.",https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif,https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/covid-scare-for-team-india-rishabh-pant-among-two-positive-7406803/,"Two members of the Indian cricket team touring England – wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant and training assistant Dayanand Garani — have tested positive for the Covid-19 virus.While Pant has been under quarantine for over a week at a relative’s house, Garani has been isolated at a London hotel where the entire squad had checked in earlier this week.Three others – wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha, opener Abhimanyu Easwaran and bowling coach B Arun — have been identified as close contacts of Garani. They have been asked to confine themselves to their rooms for 10 days as a precaution.The Indian team, minus Pant and the four others in isolation, has moved from London to Durham where they will play a practice game before the first Test against England on August 4.The BCCI, in a press statement, said Pant was “asymptomatic” and “will be able to join the squad in Durham after returning two negative RT-PCR tests”.Speaking to The Indian Express, BCCI vice-president Rajiv Shukla, without naming Pant, said, “One player has tested positive but he has been in isolation for the last eight days. He was not staying in any hotel with the team. He did not meet any player, so no other player has been affected.”“As players were allowed to go out and take a break, many stayed with relatives there. So far, no other player has tested positive and our secretary, Jay Shah, has written to all players to maintain protocols,” he said.Incidentally, Shah’s communication, dated July 13, reached the players five days after Pant tested positive and a day before they were to reassemble in London for the trip to Durham. The BCCI said the wicketkeeper had tested positive on July 8.Last month, after the World Test Championship final against New Zealand, the BCCI allowed squad members to leave the bio-bubble with liberty to chalk out their own accommodation and travel plans. With social-distancing protocols relaxed in England, the players and coaching staff, during the three-week break, were seen in crowded stands at the Euro 2020 games and the Wimbledon tennis championship.Pant and Jasprit Bumrah had posted photographs on social media from football games while coach Ravi Shastri tweeted a selfie from the sidelines of Novak Djokovic’s history-making Grand Slam final at the grass-court tournament.Shah’s advice to players to stay away from “mass congregations” came a couple of days after the Euro 2020 and Wimbledon final on July 11. “In fact, the new variant is spreading rapidly, and we are not out of the danger zone … In view of this, it is advisable that places of mass congregation, crowded shopping malls/stores and watering holes be avoided by you in the best interest of everyone,” he said.“I am sure everyone understands the gravity of the situation. Please follow the Covid-19 protocols and stay within the team environment, which is a more controlled one,” he said.The letter underlined the challenges the England Cricket Board (ECB) has faced in organising the tour during the pandemic. “I am pleased that BCCI’s excellent working relationship with the ECB has enabled us to administer a second dose of the vaccine to each one of you and also to your family members and caretakers. While this surely boosts our fighting capacity against the virus, it by no means guarantees total immunity or resistance against the dreaded virus.”Shah also reminded players and support staff of the perils of dropping the guard. “You may be aware that the ECB was forced to field another team to play against Pakistan and even the white-ball series between India and Sri Lanka had to be postponed,” he said.Shukla stated that one needs to understand that Indian players have been in bio-bubbles for months before they travelled to England.“Players have been staying in a bio-bubble for the past few months now. The situation in the UK is different, the government has opened and relaxed norms. So it was decided to allow our players to take a much-needed break and join the team again later. Jay was in constant touch with the team management and was checking what was happening in England,” he said.The entire travelling contingent is taking the lateral flow test on a daily basis, the BCCI press release said."

Bowling coach Bharath Arun, Wriddhiman Saha, and Abhimanyu Easwaran have also been asked to isolate themselves after coming in close contact with Garani.However, these developments have set the alarm bells ringing across the cricket fraternity. Former England captain Michael Vaughan raised concerns over the upcoming five-Test series between India and England, saying a change to COVID-19 related isolation laws is the need of the hour.“I fear for the 100 & the Indian Test series unless the isolation laws change .. we are bound to have cases as is the case with @RishabhPant17.. plus further down the line I fear the Ashes could be hugely affected with players pulling out unless bubbles/quarantine rules change!” Vaughan wrote on Twitter.I fear for the 100 & the Indian Test series unless the isolation laws change .. we are bound to have cases as is the case with @RishabhPant17 .. plus further down the line I fear the Ashes could be hugely affected with players pulling out unless bubbles/quarantine rules change !— Michael Vaughan (@MichaelVaughan) July 15, 2021Former India seamer Mohit Sharma spoke to indianexpress.com and said that it would be unfair to implement stringent rules for those in the bubble. He also raised a pertinent question as to how will a completely foolproof method be devised so that players do not come in close contact with anyone outside of the bubble environment.“The virus can catch anyone from anywhere. It is very difficult to predict now. The entire of England was out on the streets during the Euros, how will u stop people?” he inquired.“As far as the series being affected is concerned, I think only time will tell. I hope it does not get cancelled. But I am sure the Indian team will be waiting for Pant to get back and train,” he added.After Pant returned with a positive result more than a week back, fans were quick to point a finger at him for not wearing a mask.

We don’t want to be closeting players in such a place where they feel like the only role they play in their life is to is to go out and bat and bowl for whatever team they’re playing.”“I think that’s a bad place for us to be,” Harrison added in a virtual press conference.“We have to be understanding about what it is to be a responsible employer, to be able to get the best back from players. That’s by treating them like adults, and talking and communicating openly about how we best mitigate the impacts of this ongoing pandemic.”“We are working through that at the moment,” he said. “Clearly we’ve got to make sure that we protect the India series.As of Thursday, the entire Indian team sans the six were off to Durban where they will begin their preparations with a three-day warm-up game at Emirates Riverside against County XI starting next Tuesday."

16,"The block that keeps the NBA Finals alive
July 15, 2021 8:47:06 pmThe Phoenix Suns have done well to win the first two games of these NBA Finals and were close to taking one of the two games on the road.",https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif,https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/basketball/the-block-that-keeps-the-nba-finals-alive-7406599/,"Bucks live to fight another dayThe Milwaukee Bucks capitalised on home court advantage to level the NBA Finals 2-2 after beating the Phoenix Suns 109-103 in Game 4 on Wednesday. But the play that sealed the deal for them – by their superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo – was one that will be looked at as the moment that changed this series – if the Bucks go on to lift the 2021 NBA championship.Historical contextFive years ago in the NBA Finals, a Golden State Warriors (GSW) team on its way to be considered the greatest team in the history of the NBA was stopped by LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and the Cleveland Cavaliers. GSW led the final series 3-1 and no team in the history of the NBA had ever recovered from that deficit.But LeBron and the Cavs levelled the series and then in Game 7, produced a moment that continues to be spoken about five years later. With 2:03 left on the clock in the fourth quarter and the scores tied at 89-apiece, GSW got a break with Steph Curry on the ball. He made a pass to Andre Iguodala who went for a layup to give his team the lead. But LeBron had made up ground by now and leapt towards the basket at the same time as Iguodala went up and blocked the shot on the backboard. The block ended up being ‘the play’ that decided the series.Giannis’ Finals moment?On Wednesday in Game 4, Giannis had a similar moment that could be talked about for years to come. The Milwaukee Bucks were leading 101-99 when the Suns centre Deandre Ayton (being guarded by Anteokounmpo) passed the ball to Devin Booker. Ayton, after passing the ball, got himself into a good position to score when Booker launched a pass. But Antetokounmpo, who had his back to Ayton, miraculously pivoted and leapt off his left leg – the same left leg that he had hyper-extended a mere two weeks ago – and flew towards the backboard.Ayton, who was mid-air at this point and still possibly believed that this was an easy basket, was suddenly met by the 2.21m wingspan of the Greek Freak. Giannis’ somehow managed to put his hand between the ball and the rim and stop a sure-shot two-pointer. “I thought I was going to get dunked on, to be honest with you,” Antetokounmpo said later. “But you know, going down the stretch, just do whatever it takes to win the game. Just put yourself in a position that can win the game.”What should have been a clear two-point-play that could have levelled the scores at a crucial juncture ended up being a game-saving rejection from Bucks’ two-time MVP. The moment would have been iconic either way. If Giannis’ hand hadn’t come out of nowhere to block Ayton, it would have been possibly looked at as one of the defining plays of these NBA Finals.How this changes the finalThe Phoenix Suns have done well to win the first two games of these NBA Finals and were close to taking one of the two games on the road. By stopping that from happening, Giannis and the Bucks have levelled this series and given Milwaukee life in these Finals.LeBron’s ‘The block’ isn’t just significant for when it happened, but also for how it changed the tide of the series. Up until that point, the Cavaliers were constantly trying to catch up. But after that block, they had the confidence to go ahead and take the series against all odds.Giannis’ block may be viewed in the same light as well. The Bucks have been trailing this series from the start, and when it looked like Phoenix were on the verge of a comeback, Milwaukee’s superstar came to their rescue to keep the series alive.If Phoenix had won on Wednesday, the Bucks would only have the 2016 Cavs to look at for inspiration when it came to coming back from 3-1 down in an NBA Finals. This win, powered by that block, means both teams will now have to regroup and come back harder in Game 5, which will take place in Phoenix."

There will be a connection from 2022, however, when Barcelona builds a cricket ground thanks to an upwelling of public support for a women’s team.Barcelona’s city hall asked citizens last month to choose an initiative as part of a 30 million euro ($35 million) investment package in new facilities and improvements to public spaces.The plan to spend 1.2 million euros ($1.4 million) on a cricket pitch finished first in the voting among 184 proposals.The big win for a sport largely unknown in Spain is thanks to a campaign led by a group of young women, mostly first-generation Spaniards, some of them Indian and Pakistani immigrants living in working-class suburbs of Barcelona.What started by word of mouth soon generated traction once it caught the attention of the local media.“It’s a dream come true to have won the vote after all the effort we put in,” said cricket player Nadia Mustafa, an 18-year-old university student.“We spent weeks encouraging people to vote for our project so we could win. And in the end, we were able to get the first cricket field in Barcelona for us to play and train.”Besides the pitch, the project includes changing and storage rooms, lights, and other amenities specific to cricket.Barcelona has large Pakistani and Indian communities, and there are some 400 cricketers in Barcelona divided among 25 men’s and women’s teams.But the Mediterranean city doesn’t have facilities for this still exotic sport. Instead, an empty parking lot or field has to do for those looking to show their batting and bowling skills.Now, players will have their own pitch, right next to Barcelona’s Olympic Stadium on a hill overlooking the city.“We are happy.

No matter how many [titles he] wins or what he wins, it can never be compared to what Diego did.”"

July 15, 2021 2:30:03 pmPakistan's fielding has come under heavy scrutiny in the ODI series.",https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif,https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/eng-vs-pak-sarfaraz-ahmed-shadab-khan-clash-during-final-odi-7406038/,"Pakistan’s poor display in its 3-0 defeat to England’s second-string team in the one-day series was indefensible.During the third ODI, there were a number of moments when the men in green let the match slip away from their grasp. One such incident that could have caused much embarassment to the visitors occured during England’s run-chase of 332.Lewis Gregory, who was batting on 77 off 68 balls, hit one up in the air off Haris Rauf’s bowling. However, a mistimed shot resulted in a catching opportunity for wicket-keeper Sarfaraz Ahmed.However, Shadab Khan, from mid-off came running towards the ball, resulting in confusion between the two before finally taking a good catch.What followed was a hilarious mid-match moment of anger between the two.Former Sri Lankan wicketkeeper-batsman Kumar Sangakkara expressed his views on the catch and said, “Sarfaraz Ahmed had no interest in going for that catch, yet Shadab Khan was being told off by Sarfaraz for taking a catch that should have been taken by the wicket-keeper.”Taptaan bichara end main substitute fielder ke torr pe aya aur wahan pe bhi zaleel hogaya. Hate to see the end of #Sarfraz like this, a player like Shadab whom he had mentored is blaming him for leaving a catch in quite some fashion on an international stage 🤦🏻‍♂️ #ENGvsPAK #Shadab pic.twitter.com/URJki3MW0P— Hashim Imran (@Hashue) July 14, 2021In the end, England chased down the target by 3 wickets and won the series by 3-0."

0,"Visiting Maldives again: Remember these Covid guidelines before planning a trip
July 16, 2021 1:20:34 pmAll tourists -- including those who have received both the doses of their Covid vaccine -- must produce a negative RT-PCR test report",https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif,https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/destination-of-the-week/visiting-maldives-covid-guidelines-trip-indian-travellers-pandemic-hotel-stay-accommodation-safety-masks-rtpcr-test-7407504/,"One of the most favoured international destinations for tourists — especially in the pandemic, wherein travelling to foreign countries has slowed and almost stopped — Maldives reopened for visitors from India on July 15.It had previously suspended the entry of South Asian travellers, effective May 13, when the second wave was at its peak. Keep in mind, however, that tourists may be accommodated in guesthouses at local islands only after July 30, 2021.Now, after almost two months, the restrictions have been eased a bit, and tourists will be issued a visa on-arrival.Here are some important things to keep in mind:* In order to be able to visit the island country, you must be able to show a confirmation of your hotel reservation at the airport.* All tourists — including those who have received both the doses of their Covid vaccine — must produce a negative RT-PCR test report, with samples taken at least 48 hours and at most 72 hours, prior to departure.* In addition, you will also need to submit an online health declaration form on the Maldives immigration portal 24 hours before your arrival.* Right now, Indian tourists are not allowed to visit Greater Male, because of its dense local population.* They can, however, split their stay between hotels. But, it is mandatory that the facilities meet government guidelines and have approvals from the Ministry of Tourism in Maldives. Additionally, tourists are required to inform the facilities about their plans to spend a few days at another resort.* While visitors are not required to quarantine on arrival, if they — or a person in their group — show Covid symptoms, they will have to take an RT-PCR test and quarantine at a resort or a transit facility until the reports arrive. The cost of the accommodation may have to be borne by them.* Those travelling to Maldives from India can be tourists, Maldives nationals, expatriates and their dependents holding a work permit. And those who travel from Maldives back to India must be Indian nationals, and those with OCI (Overseas Citizen of India) cardholders holding Maldivian passports. This category also includes foreigners (including diplomats) who hold a valid visa issued by an Indian Mission under the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).* Keep in mind that after you enter India from your stay in the Maldives, you will have to present another negative RT-PCR test certificate. Make sure you inform the property where you stay, so the management can arrange for it before your check-out.* Carry a mask and wear it in public at all times. Also download the Maldives contact tracing app, TraceEkee, before your travel.Good luck!For more lifestyle news, follow us: Twitter: lifestyle_ie | Facebook: IE Lifestyle | Instagram: ie_lifestyle"
1,"‘Invisible Brown Man’: A painfully-real, funny take on Hollywood’s problem with tokenism
 July 16, 2021  12:32:31 pmPeppered with humour, the short -- written by Pritesh Shah and Dennis Fallon -- begins to decry Hollywood's fallacies from the outset. It screened at Yellowstone International Film Festival earlier this month",https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif,https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/art-and-culture/invisible-brown-man-a-painfully-real-funny-take-on-hollywoods-ancient-problem-with-tokenism-7405084/,"For some time now, Hollywood’s tokenism, blatant disregard for representation, sometimes culture appropriation, misrepresentation and whitewashing has made news around the world. It is almost like it has been going through an identity crisis, a very public one, aware of a hankering for inclusivity, but too lazy to do anything about it.So, while filmmakers continue to project their aspirations — cast in the imagery of multicultural films — the reality remains a far cry.Remember when Priyanka Chopra Jonas was called a ‘global scam artist’ for ‘tricking’ a naive white man into marrying her just so she could forge ahead and bolster her career in Hollywood? When Chopra married singer-songwriter Nick Jonas in 2018, she was already an A-lister in Bollywood. But while trying to find a footing in the West, she had to face rejections, some purely on account of her skin colour.In one of her interviews, she had shared that she had once lost out on a Hollywood role because she is a woman of colour. “I was out for a movie, and somebody [from the studio] called one of my agents and said, ‘She’s the wrong — what word did they use? — ‘physicality’. So in my defense as an actor, I’m like, ‘Do I need to be skinnier? Do I need to get in shape? Do I need to have abs?’ Like, what does ‘wrong physicality’ mean? And then my agent broke it down for me. Like, ‘I think, Priy, they meant that they wanted someone who’s not brown.’ It affected me,” she was quoted as telling InStyle magazine.And that brings us to the Invisible Brown Man, which packs many problematic themes into a 13-minute film. It screened at Yellowstone International Film Festival earlier this month.Peppered with humour, the short — written by Pritesh Shah and Dennis Fallon — begins to decry Hollywood’s fallacies from the outset. Shah’s Tejas Desai is the eponymous brown man who, at 30, has given one too many auditions, without any conclusive breakthrough.It is almost as if Tejas is acutely aware that he only gets a few minutes to tell his story. So he breaks the fourth wall often, and reminds viewers that he is not Dev Patel, because Hollywood, he alleges, can only ever reserve a seat for one brown actor, and everyone else is a “rip-off”, desperately waiting for their moment to shine.In one of the scenes, as he auditions for the role of a doctor, he is asked by the casting agent to “dig into [his] heritage”, “call on [his] past”, and “dive deep into the suffering of [his] upbringing”.“You mean, do an Indian accent?!” he asks, to which the agent asks him to imagine like he has “gone home”, assuming he is from India, and alluding to the ‘pain’ and ‘suffering’ that first world countries associate with the Indian subcontinent.But Tejas grew up in San Diego — an information that is of little importance to casting directors and agents.Tokenism, he says, is so pervasive that “every time a person of colour gets cast in a role, Hollywood acts like it cured cancer”.“#OscarsSoWhite” has been mentioned a couple of times in the film, mainly from the context of having a seemingly progressive outlook towards casting brown actors — or actors of colour — but going ahead with a white person, anyway. Or type casting and parodying a brown person. The hashtag — often used to call out the lack of diversity in nominations for the Academy Awards, or the Oscars — is believed to have been first tweeted by activist April Reign in 2015. In 2016, it had a revival of sorts, when the Academy announced acting nominations, and it exclusively comprised white actors.While some portions of the film feel particularly embroidered — like Tejas’ very awkward lunch rendezvous with his Dilli-wali negotiating family — the film does a sincere job of pulling a constant thread of holding an industry accountable for not being diverse enough, and not utilising a crop of talented actors.Directed by Roxy Shih, the short ends on an uplifting note, making it a must-watch; especially since it is pulled from real experiences of many aspiring South Asian actors.For more lifestyle news, follow us: Twitter: lifestyle_ie | Facebook: IE Lifestyle | Instagram: ie_lifestyle"

While genetic factors may play a role, belly fat can also be controlled with a few lifestyle tweaks, suggested ayurvedic practitioner Dr Shyam VL.According to him, one should look to ‘melt the belly fat away naturally’ with some effective, easy-to-follow Ayurvedic tips. “Belly fat might look stubborn but with right diet and exercise, you can melt fat easily. Get guidance from an Ayurvedic doctor to help you work with a detailed plan,” he mentioned.  A post shared by Dr Shyam VL BAMS, MD, MPhil (@drshyamayurveda)Here’s what you should keep in mind“Eat 50 per cent of your daily calories at lunch as your digestive power is the strongest at that time. Eat the least number of calories at dinner, which should be before 7pm,” he said.*Reduce consumption of refined carbohydrates; stay away from sweets, sweetened drinks, and foods rich in oil.Count on these simple tips*Consume fine powder of roasted fenugreek seeds with water in the morning on an empty stomach or you can soak fenugreek seeds overnight and consume them in the morning on an empty stomach*According to Dr Shyam, garcinia cambogia fruit enhances taste, improves digestion and boosts metabolism which helps lose weight.*Triphala helps eliminate toxins from the body and rejuvenates the digestive system.How to use? Take a teaspoon of triphala powder with warm water two hours post-dinner.*Dry ginger powder contains thermogenic agents that are useful to burn fat.

6,"Should you take a walk right after a meal? Here’s what experts say
July 16, 2021 9:10:53 amActor Sonnalli Seygall, who regularly shares engaging videos busting some common myths around fitness, also took to Instagram to talk about the same",https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif,https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/fitness/sonnalli-seygall-walking-digestion-issue-post-meals-fitness-myth-7405728/,"Many of us take a walk right after a meal to digest the food and burn the calories. But, according to experts, it may not be the best practice as doing so impacts the digestion process.Yoga trainer Priyamvada Mangal suggests that one should refrain from walking right after meals as it diverts the energy from the process of digestion. “Sitting in Vajrasana is recommended. One should only relax, or not do anything that consumes a lot of energy which is otherwise needed to digest food. And even when walking, it should be really slow, or a stroll, but not immediately after meals,” she said.Taking to Instagram, actor Sonnalli Seygall who regularly shares engaging videos busting some common myths around fitness, also said that walking right after a meal is not a great idea.“For years we’ve heard that walking immediately after your meals helps you in keeping your weight in check and aids in digestion. Wrong. Indulging in movement post your meals will only slow your digestion processes by diverting your blood flow away from the digestive system hence leading to acid reflux, stomach upset etc,” she mentioned.  A post shared by Sonnalli Seygall (Sonali) (@sonnalliseygall)Then what should you be doing?“Instead, sit still, preferably in Vajrasana or thunderbolt pose. “Even lying down on your left side helps in digestion. Go on, rest it out after eating and take that walk much later when the food is well digested in your tummy,” added Seygall.Is it so?According to medicalnewstoday.com, a person should consider the length, intensity, and timing of their post-meal walk. As per the website, gentle walking after a meal has various health benefits but high-intensity exercise is not recommended as the process of digestion starts in the mouth as soon as a person starts eating, and can continue for hours afterward. It states that intense, strenuous exercise can cause digestive distress.The Center for Disease Control or CDC recommends 30 minutes of walking anytime of the day. So, instead of opting for brisk walk, one can take a stroll post-meal or opt for a brisk walk in the morning or evenings rather than right after a meal. “Walking after a meal can help promote better sleep. Still, it is a good idea to talk to a doctor or a fitness expert before walking post meals,” said Dr Jinendra Jain, consultant physician, Wockhardt Hospital, Mira Road.What’s your opinion?For more lifestyle news, follow us: Twitter: lifestyle_ie | Facebook: IE Lifestyle | Instagram: ie_lifestyle"

He touched upon various aspects of personal growth while pointing to the blind spots we tend to gather with age. “If you want credit for the good, take responsibility for the bad,” he said.He went on say, [W]hatever you do with your life, be a builder. You don’t have to start from scratch to build something monumental. And, conversely, the best founders – the ones whose creations last and whose reputations grow rather than shrink with passing time – they spend most of their time building, piece by piece.”“Builders are comfortable in the belief that their life’s work will one day be bigger than them – bigger than any one person. They’re mindful that its effects will span generations. That’s not an accident. In a way, it’s the whole point,” Cook continued.“Don’t get distracted. There are too many people who want credit without responsibility. Too many who show up for the ribbon cutting without building anything worth a damn. Be different. Leave something worthy,” he said, before adding the concluding words: “And always remember that you can’t take it with you. You’re going to have to pass it on.”"

July 15, 2021 10:30:31 pmAround the world, 2 billion people in 130 countries eat insects regularly. The global edible insect market is poised to boom, according to investment bank Barclay's, citing data from Meticulous Research that forecasts it will grow from less than USD 1 billion in 2019 to USD 8 billion by 2030.",https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif,https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/food-wine/what-pairs-with-beetle-startups-seek-to-make-bugs-tasty-7406046/,"Tiziana Di Costanzo makes pizza dough from scratch, mixing together flour, yeast, a pinch of salt, a dash of olive oil and something a bit more unusual – ground acheta domesticus, better known as cricket powder.Di Costanzo is an edible insect entrepreneur who holds cricket and mealworm cooking classes at her West London home, where she also raises the critters in a backyard shed with her husband, Tom.Her startup, Horizon Insects, is part of Europe’s nascent edible insect scene, which features dozens of bug-based businesses offering cricket chips in the Czech Republic, bug burgers in Germany and Belgian beetle beer. The European Union headquarters in Brussels is also backing research into insect-based proteins as part of a broader sustainable food strategy.As the Earth’s growing population puts more pressure on global food production, insects are increasingly seen as a viable food source. Experts say they’re rich in protein, yet can be raised much more sustainably than beef or pork.Around the world, 2 billion people in 130 countries eat insects regularly. The global edible insect market is poised to boom, according to investment bank Barclay’s, citing data from Meticulous Research that forecasts it will grow from less than USD 1 billion in 2019 to USD 8 billion by 2030.But despite all the European startups working to make insects appetizing, don’t expect them to start appearing at mainstream restaurants or on dinner tables just yet. One big reason is a strong cultural “yuck” factor in Western countries that Arnold van Huis, a professor of tropical entomologist at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, says will be hard to change.“It’s very difficult to turn people’s minds around but insects are absolutely safe to eat, maybe even more nutritious than meat products,” with the only risk coming from allergies, because insects are closely related to crustaceans like shrimp, van Huis said.Instead, humans may end up eating more insects indirectly because the market that shows the most promise is for feeding animals. The EU approved insect protein as feed for fish farming in 2017. The US Food and Drug Administration approved it for chicken feed in 2018, while EU approval for poultry and pigs is due later this year.Regulatory change has also made things easier for European companies looking to market insects directly to consumers. The EU didn’t previously govern edible insects because they weren’t considered food, leaving individual countries to impose their own rules. To bring rules in line across countries, the EU in 2018 launched a directive that covers insects but requires approvals for individual species, paving the way for a wave of authorizations.European production of insect-based food products is forecast to mushroom from from 500 metric tons currently to 260,000 metric tons by 2030, according to the International Platform of Insects for Food and Feed, a Brussels-based lobby group.Insects require a tenth of the land, account for a fraction of greenhouse gas or ammonia emissions and need much less water than cattle or pigs, van Huis said.The first approval came earlier this year for Tenebrio molitor larva, or dried yellow mealworm, after an application from French insect farm Micronutris. The EU Commission’s food safety regulators said in a scientific opinion that mealworms are safe to eat, though they warned of possible reactions in people allergic to crustaceans or dust mites.Regulators issued another positive opinion this month for grasshoppers, based on an application from Protix, a Netherlands-based insect farming company.“Our vision is that insects will go from niche to normal,” said Protix CEO Kees Aarts, who predicted an ‘explosion of food applications’ to EU regulators.At Protix’s state-of-the-art vertical farm in Bergen op Zoom, green plastic crates stacked in towering columns are filled with wriggling black soldier fly larvae.The high-tech facility turns the larvae into protein meal and oil for use in fish feed and pet food. The company also has a line of bug-based snacks and ingredients like cinnamon mealworms and cricket protein falafel mix and, after getting final approval, plans to market frozen, dried or powdered grasshoppers as an ingredient for breakfast cereals, pasta, baked goods, sauces and imitation meat.In London, Di Costanzo’s Horizon Insects is developing an insect-based cooking ingredient after discovering that there wasn’t much of a local market for the fresh edible mealworms they were selling.Di Costanzo says the cricket powder she uses in her pizza gives it “a very nice, meaty, healthy taste’ while boosting the nutritional content with protein, macronutrients and omega acids. Mealworm burgers, meanwhile, are ‘tasty and very easy to make,’ and powdered mealworms have a mild taste that allows them to be incorporated into cakes, bread and pasta.“Definitely, I think the future is products made with insects rather than the actual insect,” said Di Costanzo, who also bemoaned post-Brexit government red tape that’s leaving small U.K. edible insect entrepreneurs in limbo.Antoine Hubert, CEO of France’s Ynsect, says the most lucrative opportunity will come from the sports and health nutrition markets for its mealworm-based protein powder. The company also makes insect protein for fish feed that Hubert said helps farmed salmon grow bigger and faster while reducing the need for fishmeal – smaller fish caught in huge quantities – which helps improve the ocean’s biodiversity.Investors including Hollywood star Robert Downey Jr.’s FootPrint Coalition were among the backers contributing to Ynsect’s latest round of funding worth USD 224 million. The money will fund a vertical farm north of Paris that it says will be one of the world’s biggest when it’s completed next year, capable of producing 100,000 tons year of commercial mealworm products, as well as expansion in North America, where it plans to build another farm in the US and apply for FDA approval for its food products.Downey Jr. has been promoting the benefits of mealworm powder, supplying a tub of it to talk show host Stephen Colbert.“I could put this in a smoothie or something?” Colbert asked.“You’ll be making all kinds of stuff out of it,” Downey Jr replied."

But when stored for long, they lose some amount of freshness and gradually begin to sprout as well.Turns out, you need to take some simple measures to store potatoes for long. Chef Kunal Kapur shared some tips and tricks in an Instagram post.“Did you know that potatoes can last longer than any other fruits and vegetables? But eventually, they start to sprout green shoots and lose some of their freshness and flavour. If you know how to store them properly, they’ll stay fresh for weeks, or possibly even months, longer,” he wrote.Here’s what the chef suggested:  A post shared by Kunal Kapur (@chefkunal)*Store potatoes in a cool, well-ventilated place.
*Colder temperatures such as in the refrigerator, cause a potato’s starch to convert to sugar, resulting in a sweet taste and discolouration when cooked.
*Avoid areas that reach high temperatures or receive too much sunlight. Always in a cool dark place away from dirt sunlight.*Perforated plastic bags and paper bags offer the best environment for extending shelf-life.
*Don’t wash potatoes before storing. Dampness promotes early spoilage.
*Green on the skin of a potato is the build-up of a chemical called Solanine. It is a natural reaction to the potato being exposed to too much light.
*Solanine produces a bitter taste and if eaten in large quantity can cause illness.
*If there is slight greening, cut away the green portions of the potato skin before cooking and eating.
*Sprouts are a sign that the potato is trying to grow. Storing potatoes in a cool, dry, dark location that is well ventilated will reduce sprouting.
*Cut the sprouts away before cooking or eating the potato.How about trying these the next time you buy potatoes?"

July 15, 2021 7:10:46 pmSubway CEO John Chidsey that the company was ""very proud of our tuna""",https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif,https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/food-wine/tuna-sandwich-controversy-subway-ceo-says-it-is-one-of-his-favourites-7406100/,"Following the study that found “no amplifiable tuna DNA” in Subway’s tuna sandwich, the sandwich chain’s CEO has defended its food product in the wake of the controversy.Speaking to CNN, John Chidsey said the company was “very proud of our tuna”. The CEO said that the tuna sandwich was, in fact, one of his two favourite items on their menu.Chidsey said that the previous complaint about the presence of tuna DNA was amended in June to state that Subway tuna is “100 per cent tuna”. But now it is being questioned what kind of tuna is used.“They question what kind of tuna it is. But they acknowledge it is 100 per cent tuna. That’s not the real issue. I say follow the science, and if you follow the science, once tuna is cooked, its DNA becomes denatured, which means when you go to test it, you can’t tell one way or the other,” he said.The CEO further revealed that while the company has worked to refresh its menu for the last 15-16 months, tuna was the one sandwich ingredient “we did not touch”. “We worked on turkey. We worked on ham. We worked on chicken. We worked on steak. People love our tuna,” he was quoted as saying.Subway’s menu revamp will include changes to more than 20 items like new bread products, smashed avocado and upgrades to ham and turkey, reported Independent."

Do not take this lightly at all. Do not get bogged down, you will surely be able to manage this condition with timely intervention,” said Dr Kaur.Treatment and preventionAccording to Dr Mahajan, the treatment can be based on medications and antidepressants.

19,"Alcohol drinking linked to over 62,000 new cancer cases in India last year: Lancet study
 July 15, 2021  2:47:37 pmAlcohol consumption has been shown to cause DNA damage through increased production of harmful chemicals in the body, and affect hormone production, which can contribute to cancer development, according to the researchers",https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif,https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/health/alcohol-drinking-linked-to-over-62000-new-cancer-cases-in-india-last-year-lancet-study-7406105/,"Alcohol consumption was associated with 62,100 or five per cent of newly diagnosed cancer cases last year in India, according to a study published in The Lancet Oncology journal which shows alcohol use is on the rise in the country.Globally, the researchers found that more than 740,000 or four per cent of new cancer cases in 2020 may be attributed to alcohol drinking.The study estimates that men accounted for 77 per cent (568,700 cases) of alcohol-associated cancer cases, compared with women, who accounted for 23 per cent of cases (172,600).Cancers of the oesophagus, liver, and breast accounted for the largest number of cases.Based on data from previous years, it shows that in 2020, there were more than 6.3 million cases of mouth, pharynx, voice box (larynx), oesophageal, colon, rectum, liver, and breast cancer.These cancers have well-established causal links to alcohol consumption, and the estimates of the direct associations with alcohol in the new study are the first of their kind for 2020.“Trends suggest that although there is a decrease in alcohol consumption per person in many European countries, alcohol use is on the rise in Asian countries such as China and India, and in sub-Saharan Africa,” said Harriet Rumgay of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), France.“In addition, there is evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased rates of drinking in some countries,” Rumgay said.The researchers call for greater public awareness of the link between alcohol and cancers and increased government interventions to reduce its consumption in worst-affected regions.The study highlights the contribution of even relatively low levels of drinking to rates of cancer, which is concerning, but also suggests that small changes to public drinking behaviour could positively impact future cancer rates.Alcohol consumption has been shown to cause DNA damage through increased production of harmful chemicals in the body, and affect hormone production, which can contribute to cancer development, according to the researchers.Alcohol can also worsen the cancer-causing effects of other substances, such as tobacco, they said.In the new study, researchers established levels of alcohol intake per person per country for 2010, to allow for the time it takes for alcohol intake to affect possible cancer development.They then combined them with new cancer cases in 2020 to estimate the number of alcohol-associated cancers in each country.Moderate drinking was classed as intake of up to two alcoholic drinks, risky drinking as between two and six alcoholic drinks per day, and heavy drinking as more than six alcoholic drinks per day.Globally, an estimated 4 per cent (741,300) of all new cases of cancer in 2020 were associated with alcohol consumption, the researchers said.The study found that risky drinking and heavy drinking led to the largest proportion of cancer cases at 39 per cent (291,800 cases) and 47 per cent (346,400 cases) respectively.However, moderate drinking was also found to be problematic, with estimates that this level of drinking accounted for 14 per cent (103,100 cases) of the total of alcohol-caused cases.Eastern Asia and Central and Eastern Europe regions had the highest proportions of cancer cases that could be associated with alcohol at 6 per cent, with the lowest proportions found in Northern Africa and Western Asia, both below 1 per cent.At a country level, the proportions of cancer cases associated with alcohol were estimated to be highest in Mongolia (10 per cent) and lowest in Kuwait (estimated at 0 per cent).India had an estimated 5 per cent (62,100) of cancer cases linked to alcohol, while China 6 per cent (282,300), Germany 4 per cent (21,500 cases) and France had 5 per cent (20,000 cases).The UK had an estimated 4 per cent of cancer cases linked to alcohol (16,800), with the US at 3 per cent (52,700), and Brazil at 4 per cent (20,500 cases).“We urgently need to raise awareness about the link between alcohol consumption and cancer risk among policy makers and the general public,” said Rumgay.The researchers noted that public health strategies, such as reduced alcohol availability, labelling alcohol products with a health warning, and marketing bans could reduce rates of alcohol-driven cancer.Tax and pricing policies that have led to decreased alcohol intake in Europe, including increased excise taxes and minimum unit pricing, could also be implemented in other world regions, they added."

When you look at the ingredient label on a package of mass-produced bread or those labelled ‘gluten free’, ‘multi-grain’, you’ll see a lot more than few basic ingredients. There is just a lot of junk in these breads, even in the supposed “healthy” stuff. Buy breads from a local bakery and if you can buy from the person who actually baked it (and can tell you how they baked it), that’s even better!” she said.She also shared a picture of Goa’s locally made Poi bread.  A post shared by ‘Yuktahaar’by Munmun Ganeriwal (@munmun.ganeriwal)According to WebMD, it is important to watch the sodium content in bread.If it’s 100 per cent whole wheat, the first ingredient listed in the ingredient label will be whole-wheat flour or 100 per cent whole-wheat flour, it mentioned.Whole grains are known to be naturally low in fat and cholesterol free; contain protein, and offer loads of healthy fibre, resistant starch, minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants.For more lifestyle news, follow us: Twitter: lifestyle_ie | Facebook: IE Lifestyle | Instagram: ie_lifestyle"

full-scale production in front of a live audience in over a year.Based in playwright William Shakespeare’s birthplace of Stratford-upon-Avon, the company, known as the RSC, built the Lydia & Manfred Gorvy Garden Theatre outside its Swan Theatre by the River Avon.The Comedy of Errors had been due to begin performances in April 2020, but the RSC, like theatres across Britain and elsewhere, had to close its doors to live audiences due to the COVID-19 pandemic.The production has now been adapted by director Phillip Breen for the new temporary open-air venue.“It’s a beautiful spot here … right by the river, so we get some heckling from some swans occasionally,” actor Greg Haiste, who plays Dromio of Ephesus, said.Under Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s roadmap out of lockdown, entertainment venues in England have been welcoming audiences back since mid-May though at 50% capacity. From Monday, they will no longer face restrictions on numbers.The RSC’s garden theatre can sit 500 people – or 310 with social distancing.“I felt there were two really powerful reasons to build this theatre, one of which was as a sort of symbol of regeneration … but also as a transition so that people will feel very comfortable sitting outside in the open air,” RSC artistic director Gregory Doran told Reuters.“And that might then give them more confidence when we open (musical) ‘The Magician’s Elephant’ in October in the Royal Shakespeare Theatre to move back indoors.“In London’s West End, major productions including hit musicals such as “Jersey Boys” and “The Lion King” have been waiting for July 19 to be able to fully reopen as operating at 50% capacity is not financially viable."

July 15, 2021 12:30:06 pmSome people infected with the virus may show no symptoms, while others may develop symptoms such as fever, mild rash or body aches. In extreme cases, one can also show persistent headache and eye infection for 2-7 days, said Dr Manjeeta Nath Das",https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif,https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/health/zika-virus-pregnancy-symptoms-causes-prevention-treatment-woman-tips-7404526/,"Ever since Kerala reported its first case of Zika virus in a pregnant woman on July 8, a state-wide alert has been issued, and experts have been asked to monitor cases. The Zika virus infection can strike due to the Zika virus (ZIKV), which is a mosquito-borne human flavivirus. It can be transmitted via mainly Aedes mosquitoes, which bite during early mornings or even late evenings.CausesZika virus, unlike dengue and chikungunya, is also transmitted through bodily fluids like blood, and semen, or even organ transplant. “It is also known that vertical transfer from the mother to the baby can happen in pregnancy,” said Dr Aruna Muralidhar, senior consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, Fortis La Femme Hospital, Richmond Road, Bengaluru.According to World Health Organization (WHO), it was first identified in Uganda in 1947 in monkeys. It was later identified in humans in 1952 in Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania.SymptomsThe incubation period, which is the time between the exposure to the virus and symptoms, can be seen within 3-14 days, as per WHO. Some people infected with the virus may show no symptoms, while others may develop symptoms such as fever, mild rash or body aches. In extreme cases, one can also show persistent headache and eye infection for 2-7 days, mentioned Dr Manjeeta Nath Das, senior consultant, internal medicine, Columbia Asia Hospital, Palam Vihar Gurugram.“About 80 per cent are asymptomatic. The symptoms are usually mild in the ones who are symptomatic and last for about 2 to 7 days and resolve,” noted Dr Aruna.What are the risks in pregnancy?According to experts, if the infection occurs in pregnancy, there is a risk of miscarriage and certain congenital malformations. The most commonly noted foetal defect is microcephaly or a small head, stated Dr Aruna. “A combination of microcephaly and certain neurological problems is called congenital Zika syndrome. However, this does not affect every foetus born to a Zika positive mother. It is reported in about 10 per cent cases especially if the Zika infection occurs in the first trimester,” she mentioned.According to WHO, an increased risk of neurologic complications is associated with Zika virus infection in adults and children, including Guillain-Barré syndrome, neuropathy and myelitis.The WHO also states that congenital Zika syndrome includes other malformations including limb contractures, high muscle tone, eye abnormalities, and hearing loss. The risk of congenital malformations following infection in pregnancy remains unknown; an estimated 5–15 per cent of infants born to women infected with Zika virus during pregnancy have evidence of Zika-related complications. Congenital malformations occur following both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection.However, as per WHO, “Research is ongoing to investigate the effects of Zika virus infection on pregnancy outcomes”, and effects of infection on other neurological disorders in children and adults.TreatmentThere is no vaccine for Zika virus infection. The treatment is usually symptomatic with paracetamol, hydration and rest. Also, avoiding aspirin or any NSAIDs (Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or medications that relieve pain) during the infection is recommended.According to WHO, pregnant women living in areas with Zika transmission or who develop symptoms of Zika virus infection should seek medical attention for laboratory testing and other clinical care.PreventionDr Aruna suggested steps to be taken during the Zika outbreak or otherwise to prevent infection*Mosquito repellants which are safe
*All anti-mosquito measures in and around the house including full clothing

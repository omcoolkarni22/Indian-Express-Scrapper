Blue Origin said on Thursday Oliver Daemen will join the four-member all-civilian crew for Tuesday’s scheduled flight after the auction winner, whose name had not been made public, dropped out due to unspecified “scheduling conflicts.” Daemen becomes the company’s first paying customer. His addition means that the flight is set to include the oldest person ever to go to space — 82-year-old trailblazing female aviator Wally Funk — and the youngest, Daemen, according to Blue Origin. Joining them for Blue Origin’s suborbital launch will be Bezos and his brother Mark Bezos. Daemen is working to obtain his pilot’s license and is set to attend the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands to study physics and innovation management in September, Blue Origin said. His father is Somerset Capital Partners CEO and founder Joes Daemen. The elder Daemen “paid for the seat and chose to fly Oliver,” Blue Origin said. The company declined to say how much was paid. #NewShepard is go for launch on July 20 for #NSFirstHumanFlight. This is the 16th flight and first with astronauts on board.

New Shepard is a 60-foot-tall (18.3-meters-tall) and fully autonomous rocket-and-capsule combo that cannot be piloted from inside the spacecraft. The launch is set for a site in West Texas. Branson, the British billionaire businessman, was aboard his company Virgin Galactic’s rocket plane for its pioneering suborbital flight from New Mexico on Sunday."

Samsung remained the top vendor in the quarter. According to Canalys, global smartphone shipments increased 12 percent in the quarter as the new normal for economies and citizens started to take shape.Samsung was the market leader with 19 percent and nearly 15 percent annual growth. Xiaomi was number two with 17 percent market share and nearly 83 percent market share. Apple slipped to number three position with 14 percent market share. Vivo and Oppo were number four and five respectively in the list with both seeing double digit growth with 10 percent share each.“Xiaomi is growing its overseas business rapidly. For example, its shipments increased more than 300% in Latin America, 150% Africa and 50% in Western Europe. And as it grows, it evolves. It is now transforming its business model from challenger to incumbent, with initiatives such as channel partner consolidation and more careful management of older stock in the open market,” Canalys Research Manager Ben Stanton said on the company’s growth.In India, Xiaomi remains the number one vendor since 2018. Stanton also notes that while Xiaomi is still largely skewed toward the mass market, and “when compared with Samsung and Apple, its average selling price is around 40% and 75% cheaper respectively.”He added, a “major priority for Xiaomi this year is to grow sales of its high-end devices, such as the Mi 11 Ultra. But it will be a tough battle, with Oppo and Vivo sharing the same objective, and both willing to spend big on above-the-line marketing to build their brands in a way that Xiaomi is not.”"

5,Facebook says Iranian hackers used site in spying on US military personnel,https://images.indianexpress.com/2021/07/Facebook_Reuters1.jpg,https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/facebook-says-iranian-hackers-used-site-in-spying-on-us-military-personnel-7407181/,"Facebook said on Thursday it had taken down about 200 accounts run by a group of hackers in Iran as part of a cyber spying operation that targeted mostly US military personnel and people working at defense and aerospace companies.The social media giant said the group, dubbed ‘Tortoiseshell’ by security experts, used fake online personas to connect with targets, build trust sometimes over the course of several months and drive them onto other sites where they were tricked into clicking malicious links that would infect their devices with spying malware.“This activity had the hallmarks of a well-resourced and persistent operation, while relying on relatively strong
operational security measures to hide who’s behind it,” Facebook’s investigations team said in a blog post.The group, Facebook said, made fictitious profiles across multiple social media platforms to appear more credible, often posing as recruiters or employees of aerospace and defense companies. Microsoft-owned LinkedIn said it had removed a number of accounts and Twitter said it was “actively investigating” the information in Facebook’s report.Facebook said the group used email, messaging and collaboration services to distribute the malware, including through malicious Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.A Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement it was aware of and tracking this actor and that it takes action when it detects malicious activity.Alphabet Inc’s Google said it had detected and blocked phishing on Gmail and issued warnings to its users. Workplace messaging app Slack Technologies Inc said it had acted to take down the hackers who used the site for social engineering and shut down all Workspaces that violated its rules.The hackers also used tailored domains to attract its targets, Facebook said, including fake recruiting websites for defense companies, and it set up online infrastructure that spoofed a legitimate job search website for the US Department of Labor.Facebook said the hackers mostly targeted people in the United States, as well as some in the United Kingdom and Europe, in a campaign running since mid-2020. It declined to name the companies whose employees were targeted but its head of cyber espionage Mike Dvilyanski said it was notifying the “fewer than 200 individuals” who were targeted.The campaign appeared to show an expansion of the group’s activity, which had previously been reported to concentrate mostly on the IT and other industries in the Middle East, Facebook said. The investigation found that a portion of the malware used by the group was developed by Mahak Rayan Afraz (MRA), an IT company based in Tehran with ties to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Reuters could not immediately locate contact information for Mahak Rayan Afraz and former employees of the firm did not immediately return messages sent via LinkedIn.Iran’s mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment. MRA’s alleged connection to Iranian state cyber espionage is not new. Last year cybersecurity company Recorded Future said MRA was one of several contractors suspected of serving the IRGC’s elite Quds Force.Iranian government spies – like other espionage services – have long been suspected of farming out their mission to a host of domestic contractors. Facebook said it had blocked the malicious domains from being shared and Google said it had added the domains to its “blocklist.”"
6,Nintendo Switch gets new rival with Valve’s portable Steam console,https://images.indianexpress.com/2021/05/Nintendo-Switch-1-1.jpg,https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/gaming/nintendo-switch-gets-new-rival-with-valves-portable-steam-console-7407168/,"Nintendo Co.’s Switch has some new competition. Closely held video game publisher Valve Corp. introduced a portable gaming device Thursday that resembles the Switch but will have technical capabilities comparable to a gaming PC or console, according to the company.The Steam Deck, which will be available in December starting at $400, will allow users to play sophisticated computer games on the go. The device has buttons, joysticks, and small mouse pads. The form is almost identical to the Switch, which has sold more than 84 million units since its release in 2017.While the Switch, which is also a portable device, is low-powered compared with competing gaming consoles, the Steam Deck promises to run the highest-end games. Footage of the device showed titles such as Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order running on the Steam Deck, which wouldn’t be possible on the Switch. Valve said it has partnered with Advanced Micro Devices Inc. on a custom chip capable of running “the latest AAA games in a very efficient power envelope.”Valve’s online game store, Steam, is the most popular way to play games on PCs. Valve says the new device will allow users to play all of their current Steam games as if they are using their account on a different computer.“We think Steam Deck gives people another way to play the games they love on a high-performance device at a great price,” Valve chief executive officer Gabe Newell said in a statement. “As a gamer, this is a product I’ve always wanted. And as a game developer, it’s the mobile device I’ve always wanted for our partners.”"
7,Microsoft says Israeli group sold tools to hack Windows,https://images.indianexpress.com/2021/07/Microsoft_Reuters_NEW_1.jpeg,https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/microsoft-says-israeli-group-sold-tools-to-hack-windows-7407170/,"An Israeli group sold a tool to hack into Microsoft Windows, Microsoft and technology human rights group Citizen Lab said on Thursday, shedding light on the growing business of finding and selling tools to hack widely used software.The hacking tool vendor, named Candiru, created and sold a software exploit that can penetrate Windows, one of many intelligence products sold by a secretive industry that finds flaws in common software platforms for their clients, said a report by Citizen Lab.Technical analysis by security researchers details how Candiru’s hacking tool spread around the globe to numerous unnamed customers, where it was then used to target various civil society organisations, including a Saudi dissident group and a left-leaning Indonesian news outlet, the reports by Citizen Lab and Microsoft show.Attempts to reach Candiru for comment were unsuccesful. Evidence of the exploit recovered by Microsoft Corp suggested it was deployed against users in several countries, including Iran, Lebanon, Spain and the United Kingdom, according to the Citizen Lab report.“Candiru’s growing presence, and the use of its surveillance technology against global civil society, is a potent reminder that the mercenary spyware industry contains many players and is prone to widespread abuse,” Citizen Lab said in its report.Microsoft fixed the discovered flaws on Tuesday through a software update. Microsoft did not directly attribute the exploits to Candiru, instead referring to it as an “Israel-based private sector offensive actor” under the codename Sourgum.“Sourgum generally sells cyberweapons that enable its customers, often government agencies around the world, to hack into their targets’ computers, phones, network infrastructure, and internet-connected devices,” Microsoft wrote in a blog post.“These agencies then choose who to target and run the actual operations themselves.”Candiru’s tools also exploited weaknesses in other common software products, like Google’s Chrome browser. On Wednesday, Google released a blog post where it disclosed two Chrome software flaws that Citizen Lab found connected to Candiru. Google also did not refer to Candiru by name, but described it as a “commercial surveillance company.”Google patched the two vulnerabilities earlier this year.Cyber arms dealers like Candiru often chain multiple software vulnerabilities together to create effective exploits that can reliably break into computers remotely without a target’s knowledge, computer security experts say.Those types of covert systems cost millions of dollars and are often sold on a subscription basis, making it necessary for customers to repeatedly pay a provider for continued access, people familiar with the cyber arms industry told Reuters.“No longer do groups need to have the technical expertise, now they just need resources,” Google wrote in its blog post."

We just have to get better as an industry.”Nadella also discussed tensions with Google, following the end of a five-year cease-fire between the two companies, which mutually agreed not to fuel legal lobbying efforts against one another. He said he “has a lot of respect” for Google and its leadership.“We’re fighting the good fight to sort of compete against colossal lead in that space,” he said of digital advertising sales, which is led by Google and Facebook.Nadella weighed in on Microsoft’s work-from-home policy, emphasizing the importance of flexibility and accommodating “changed expectations” in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. He spoke with Bloomberg Television after appearing at Microsoft’s Inspire conference for partners, where the company among its announcements unveiled a cloud-based version of Windows aimed at remote workers.“We’ll really think about long-term policies based on, quite frankly, having all of that data behind us because otherwise I think we’re trying to come up and being too overly dogmatic,” he said."

While Clippy is not to be seen in more modern versions of Microsoft Office, the nostalgia remains intact for a lot of people from the era of Windows 98-XP. Now, it seems Microsoft has plans of bringing back the shape-shifting virtual assistant.The company took to its Twitter handle on July 14 to announce the possible return of Clippy if the tweet crosses 20,000 likes. While the character is unlikely to return in its assistant format, Microsoft may be replacing the paperclip emoji in Microsoft 365 with Clippy. Check out the tweet below.If this gets 20k likes, we’ll replace the paperclip emoji in Microsoft 365 with Clippy. pic.twitter.com/6T8ziboguC— Microsoft (@Microsoft) July 14, 2021Officially named Clippit, the bouncing character with its large, googly eyes was designed by Kevan J. Atteberry. It could change its shape and be dragged around the screen in older Office programs, offering help with various features across the MS Office toolset.While Microsoft demanded a target of 20,000 likes, the tweet has had an overwhelming response so far, gathering 1,31,900 likes, 13,100 retweets and over a thousand comments at the time of writing this story. As likely as it is, Microsoft has so far not confirmed the addition of Clippy officially.As per a report by The Verge, the paperclip almost made a return a couple of years ago when some Microsoft employees “briefly resurrected Clippy as animated stickers in Microsoft Teams”. However, the effort was quickly shut down soon after."

12,Device taps brain waves to help paralysed man communicate,https://images.indianexpress.com/2021/07/Neuro.jpg,https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/device-taps-brain-waves-paralysed-man-communicate-7406131/,"In a medical first, researchers harnessed the brain waves of a paralysed man unable to speak — and turned what he intended to say into sentences on a computer screen.It will take years of additional research but the study, reported Wednesday, marks an important step toward one day restoring more natural communication for people who can’t talk because of injury or illness.“Most of us take for granted how easily we communicate through speech,” said Dr. Edward Chang, a neurosurgeon at the University of California, San Francisco, who led the work. “It’s exciting to think we’re at the very beginning of a new chapter, a new field” to ease the devastation of patients who lost that ability.Today, people who can’t speak or write because of paralysis have very limited ways of communicating. For example, the man in the experiment, who was not identified to protect his privacy, uses a pointer attached to a baseball cap that lets him move his head to touch words or letters on a screen. Other devices can pick up patients’ eye movements. But it’s a frustratingly slow and limited substitution for speech. Tapping brain signals to work around a disability is a hot field. In recent years, experiments with mind-controlled prosthetics have allowed paralysed people to shake hands or take a drink using a robotic arm — they imagine moving and those brain signals are relayed through a computer to the artificial limb.Chang’s team built on that work to develop a “speech neuroprosthetic” — decoding brain waves that normally control the vocal tract, the tiny muscle movements of the lips, jaw, tongue and larynx that form each consonant and vowel.Volunteering to test the device was a man in his late 30s who 15 years ago suffered a brain-stem stroke that caused widespread paralysis and robbed him of speech. The researchers implanted electrodes on the surface of the man’s brain, over the area that controls speech.A computer analysed the patterns when he attempted to say common words such as “water” or “good,” eventually becoming able to differentiate between 50 words that could generate more than 1,000 sentences.Prompted with such questions as “How are you today?” or “Are you thirsty” the device eventually enabled the man to answer “I am very good” or “No I am not thirsty” — not voicing the words but translating them into text, the team reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.The @ChangLabUcsf recorded brain activity from BRAVO1's speech motor cortex, using custom neural network models to decode a set of 50 words at a rate of up to 18 words/min with up to 93% accuracy. This is an incredible milestone for restoring speech to those without a voice. pic.twitter.com/VG2NyDs11e— UCSF Neurosurgery (@NeurosurgUCSF) July 14, 2021It takes about three to four seconds for the word to appear on the screen after the man tries to say it, said lead author David Moses, an engineer in Chang’s lab. That’s not nearly as fast as speaking but quicker than tapping out a response.In an accompanying editorial, Harvard neurologists Leigh Hochberg and Sydney Cash called the work a “pioneering demonstration.” They suggested improvements but said if the technology pans out it eventually could help people with injuries, strokes or illnesses like Lou Gehrig’s disease whose “brains prepare messages for delivery but those messages are trapped.”Chang’s lab has spent years mapping the brain activity that leads to speech. First, researchers temporarily placed electrodes in the brains of volunteers undergoing surgery for epilepsy, so they could match brain activity to spoken words.Only then was it time to try the experiment with someone unable to speak. How did they know the device interpreted his words correctly? They started by having him try to say specific sentences such as, “Please bring my glasses,” rather than answering open-ended questions until the machine translated accurately most of the time.Next steps include ways to improve the device’s speed, accuracy and vocabulary size — and maybe one day allow a computer-generated voice rather than text on a screen — while testing a small number of additional volunteers."

16,A new device could turn your sweat into electricity,https://images.indianexpress.com/2021/07/fingertip-powered-wearable.jpg,https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/new-device-sweat-into-electricity-7406007/,"Researchers from UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering have developed an extremely thin and flexible wearable strip that can stick to your fingertip and generate small amounts of electricity. It can then be used as a source of power for small electronics.The electricity is generated when your finger sweats and can be worn even when sleeping. The device can also generate extra power when you press on it. So you can continue typing on your computer, texting, or even play the piano.“Unlike other sweat-powered wearables, this one requires no exercise, no physical input from the wearer in order to be useful. This work is a step forward to making wearables more practical, convenient and accessible for the everyday person,” explained co-first author Lu Yin, a nanoengineering PhD student in a release. The findings were published on July 13 in the journal Joule.Explaining why the fingertip was chosen, Yin explained: “The reason we feel sweatier on other parts of the body is because those spots are not well ventilated. By contrast, the fingertips are always exposed to air, so the sweat evaporates as it comes out. So rather than letting it evaporate, we use our device to collect this sweat, and it can generate a significant amount of energy.”“We envision that this can be used in any daily activity involving touch, things that a person would normally do anyway while at work, at home, while watching TV or eating,” said Joseph Wang, a professor of nanoengineering and the study’s senior author in the release. “The goal is that this wearable will naturally work for you and you don’t even have to think about it.”Decoding the device You can wrap the device around your fingertip like a Band-Aid and electrodes in it absorb the sweat and convert it to electrical energy. There is also a chip underneath these electrodes that helps to generate additional electrical energy when tapped or pressed on.The team found that when worn for 10 hours of sleep, the device was able to collect 400 millijoules of energy, and during one hour of casual typing on the computer keyboard and clicking a mouse, it collected 30 millijoules. And this is just from one fingertip. Strapping devices on the rest of the fingertips would generate 10 times more energy, the researchers said.“Free energy” from sleep?
Wearable bioenergy harvesters that used to require quite a workout to generate a small power are no more!
Check out our recent paper on @Joule_CP on wearable biofuel cell harvesting energy from a touch of your fingertip!https://t.co/2zK038cAlt— Lu Yin (@YinLu_CLT) July 13, 2021“Compare this to a device that harvests energy as you exercise,” explained Yin. “When you are running, you are investing hundreds of joules of energy only for the device to generate millijoules of energy. In that case, your energy return on investment is very low. But with this device, your return is very high. When you are sleeping, you are putting in no work. Even with a single finger press, you are only investing about half a millijoule.”The team has planned more studies to combine the device with other energy harvesters and create new self-powered wearable systems."

While a stable version is still not out, this is the the sixth version that Google has released so far, including three developer previews and two public betas. The first beta included Android 12’s major design changes, and the second added Android 12’s privacy dashboard and wallpaper-based theming.With the third beta, Google has baked in some more features, including the ability to take scrolling screenshots natively and smarter auto-rotation. Here’s details on the new changes.With scrolling screenshots in Android 12, users can capture a screenshot of content that is scrollable. This is handy on longer screens and chat windows that no longer need to be clipped with individual screenshots. A number of OEM skins like Xiaomi’s MIUI or OnePlus’s OxygenOS have had the feature for years, but now it will be natively supported for the first time.Google implemented the feature in the beta for Android 11, but due to the COVID-crisis and limited resources, the feature never made it to the stable release. With it being a part of the beta 3 now, users can expect the feature to roll out with Android 12’s stable release, bringing it to phones by Motorola, Nokia, Google’s own Pixel series and more.With Beta 3, Google is bringing in platform support for AppSearch, a new high-performance on-device search engine. “With AppSearch, apps can index structured data and search over it with built-in full-text search capabilities, and they can use native features like highly-efficient indexing and retrieval, multi-language support, and relevancy ranking,” Google said in a blog post.AppSearch will be available in two “flavours” including a local index for an app that will make searching backwards compatible through a new AppSearch Jetpack Library, as well as a central index that is maintained for the entire system.“When you participate in the central index, the system will be able to display your app’s data on System UI surfaces unless you choose to opt out. Additionally, you can securely share data with other apps, allowing them to search your app’s data as well as their own,” Google added.Android 12 will also use the devices gyro-sensors with facial recognition to determine when a device should be rotated. This will result in fewer unnecessary rotations when you want the device in portrait but are simply laying down on a couch or bed. The facial recognition will also be processed on-device, making the feature secure.Other improvements include optimisations to the rotation animation and an added machine learning-driven gesture algorithm that will reduce the latency during auto-rotate kicking in by 25 percent.Android 12 beta 3 will also be adding Game Modes that will let you choose profiles for playing games. These profiles can be battery-saving for more juice when you’re away from a charger or peak performance to get maximum framerates. These APIs will be tied to the game dashboard and will be available as an overlay on top of games making them quickly accessible. Meanwhile, play as you download will allow game assets to be fetched in the background during installation, getting you into the actual gameplay faster than before.Android 12 beta 3 will also be adding new privacy indicator APIs in WindowInsets that show when an app is using the device camera or microphone. These APIs will let apps reposition the indicator with an immersive mode so users can still see it. The camera and microphone access toggles that instantly let you revoke permission for the camera and microphone from certain apps are also now configurable for enterprise administrators."

July 16, 2021 1:25:44 pmIn the 40-page detailed order made available on Friday, the court said, ""Upon perusal of the documents, this court does not find that the accusations are inherently improbable or wholly unbelievable.""",https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/elgar-parishad-anand-teltumbde-special-court-bail-order-7407451/,"In its detailed order rejecting bail to former IIT professor and academic Anand Teltumbde, arrested in the Elgar Parishad case, a special court has said he cannot be released when there is a “prima facie” case against him under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA).Special Judge Dinesh E Kothalikar had on Monday rejected the bail application of 70-year-old Teltumbde who has been behind bars since April 14, 2020.In the 40-page detailed order made available on Friday, the court said, “Upon perusal of the documents, including the exchange of emails and the statements of the witnesses relied upon by the prosecution, and after cross-checking the truthfulness of the allegations made against the applicant, this court does not find that the accusations are inherently improbable or wholly unbelievable.”It said it had to consider the rider under section 43D(5) of UAPA which states that if there are reasonable grounds for believing the accusation is prima facie true, the accused cannot be granted bail.Two days before his death, on July 5, Father Stan Swamy, Teltumbde’s co-accused in the case, had moved the Bombay High Court challenging the constitutionality of this provision, stating that the presumption of innocence was inverted due to it and it violated fundamental rights.Special Public Prosecutor Prakash Shetty, representing the National Investigation Agency (NIA), had opposed Teltumbde’s bail plea, alleging that he was an active member of the banned organisation CPI (Maoist) and was furthering its agenda. He also claimed that a witness statement showed that Teltumbde was in touch with his brother, Milind, named in the chargesheet as an absconding accused, and alleged top operative of the organisation. The NIA claimed the witness further said Milind had told him that he was inspired by Teltumbde to join the organisation.Teltumbde’s lawyer Sudeep Pasbola opposed the ground, stating that it was hearsay evidence.The court, however, agreed with the prosecution’s submission. “… the wanted accused (Milind) is the best person to state as to by whose conduct or activities he was being impressed and therefore, in my view, the statement made by the wanted accused that he was impressed by the applicant for furthering the activities of banned terrorist organisation can be said to be relevant,” the court said.The court considered 11 documents, including emails and letters, submitted by the prosecution, along with witness statements.The NIA also referred to an email by Teltumbde about a signature campaign to various authorities, including the President, Prime Minister and Chief Minister of Maharashtra in 2019, to garner support from various cross sections of society as he faced arrest in this case. The SPP called this an attempt by Teltumbde to build pressure.While Pasbola submitted that the documents referred to by the NIA are not admissible as evidence, the court said it was not expected to conduct a ‘roving inquiry’ at the stage of deciding a bail plea, and that it would amount to a “mini-trial”.The court also took into account earlier orders against Teltumbde, including the Pune court denying him anticipatory bail and the Bombay High Court’s court order rejecting his plea to quash the FIR.While Pasbola submitted that the previous orders cannot have a bearing on his current bail plea, the court said that “it is not possible to record a contrary finding” (with the earlier orders).The NIA in its chargesheet had alleged that Teltumbde used to attend international conferences and bring “foreign Maoist literature” to use for training purposes of CPI (Maoist) members. Teltumbde had said his attendance in these conferences was public information, with expenses borne by universities which had invited him due to his academic background. Teltumbde had also said he belonged to a Dalit family and had, despite hailing from a poor family, through hard work, reached the academic position in life.The court however said his educational qualification and social background cannot be considered while deciding his bail plea."

The city’s June rainfall was 152mm, which was just about normal for the onset period.The city’s seasonal rainfall, which began with a 5 per cent deficit in July, has now climbed to over 23 per cent. With no signs of continuous and good spells, this deficit would only grow during the days ahead. At present, Pune district’s rainfall is just 5 per cent above normal.The rainfall signs for Maharashtra, too, are not very good one atleast for another one week.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has, in its latest forecast, said that the monsoon trough will be briefly shifting northwards, which means that the rainfall activity over Maharashtra will once again lose steam.As per the numerical models, the monsoon trough will shift northwards from July 17 and stay there till July 20.” During this period, the rainfall will remain largely concentrated over Punjab, Haryana, north Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir. The rainfall will be realised over Konkan and Goa while the rest of Maharashtra will not experience any significant activity,” the IMD officials said.All hopes for some enhanced rainfall now lie on the low pressure system likely to form over west-central Bay of Bengal, off Odisha-coast, around July 21.” After July 21, the monsoon trough will once again move southwards and the formation of a fresh low pressure system, the rainfall will improve over central India and parts of Maharashtra,” another official said.Except Madhya Maharashtra, all remaining meteorological subdivisions of Maharashtra have benefited from rainfall in some or the other form.Even in mid-July, thunderstorms are regular over Marathwada and Vidarbha, where only Gondia district is presently short of normal rainfall. Due to medium-strong westerly winds, Konkan and Goa, too, has been receiving good rainfall, especially since July 10.During June 1 – July 15, Maharashtra has recorded 416mm or 15 per cent surplus rain.– Stay updated with the latest Pune news.

He also asked night GOs of Delhi and north district GOs to visit Red Fort at least once during their night checking. He also asked Special CPs (central zone) and security to ensure appropriate security arrangements at Red Fort,” an officer said.In the Republic Day chaos at Red Fort, close to 1,200 people on 30-40 tractors and around 150 motorcycles and cars allegedly stormed inside Red Fort, chased down and assaulted policemen, looted their anti-riot gear, held some of them hostage inside a public toilet and vandalised the ticket counter.In the chargesheet filed in connection with the Republic Day violence by a section of farm protesters, Delhi Police said the agitators wanted “to conquer/get hold of (Red Fort)” and then “make it a new protest site for farmers”.“On the night of January 26, Balaji Srivastava was asked to look after only Red Fort and he also visited Red Fort when he went out for a night patrolling two days after taking charge,” a senior police officer said.Srivastava on Thursday issued an order prohibiting flying of “sub-conventional aerial platforms” like paragliders, paramotors, UAVs, hot-air balloons and para-jumping from aircraft in Delhi until Independence Day. The order came into force from Friday and will be followed till August 16. The order says offenders will be booked under IPC Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant)."

4,"Application filed at Bombay HC against ‘arbitrary’ rejection of claims of Covid-19 patients by insurance companies
July 16, 2021 1:11:29 pmAdvocate Rajesh Inamdar filed an interim application based on his personal experience to highlight the problems faced by patients having an insurance policy in settling hospital bills at private hospitals and rejection of claims by insurance companies.",https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/application-bombay-hc-arbitrary-rejection-claims-covid-19-patients-insurance-7407532/,"Citing harassment and agony of Covid-19 patients by private hospitals and insurance companies over the settling of hospital bills, advocate Rajesh Inamdar filed an interim application at Bombay High Court seeking investigation into alleged rejection of policyholders’ claims by insurance companies in an arbitrary manner and a direction the latter to process cashless facilities for Covid patients.In an ongoing Covid-19 related case filed by Nilesh Navlakha, Inamdar filed an interim application based on his personal experience to highlight the problems faced by patients having an insurance policy in settling hospital bills at private hospitals and rejection of claims by the insurance companies.He prayed to the court to direct the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDA) to conduct an investigation under the Insurance Act and direct the insurance companies to immediately reimburse all claims of the patients which were “arbitrarily and mischievously rejected”.“The court should ask IRDA to investigate and file a report as to how many claims were rejected by insurance companies in an arbitrary, frivolous, mechanical and mischievous manner and denied benefits of insurance policy to the policyholders and have taken undue advantage of the pandemic to unjustly enrich themselves,” Inamdar said in his application.The applicant also requested the court to direct the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) to conduct an audit into affairs of all the hospitals and investigate if there is a systematic fraud played by hospitals in connivance with insurance companies to exploit and unjustly enrich themselves by denying the benefits of insurance claims to the policy holders.Incidentally, the audit of hospital bills of Covid-19 patients in private hospitals in its jurisdiction has been done by PMC and it has reduced a total of Rs 5.03 crore bill of 1,536 patients. In the first week of July, a bill amount of Rs 17.21 lakh was reduced for 188 patients who got treated at private hospitals in the city.“The insurance companies have been rejecting claims of Covid patients all over the state, citing unnecessary hospital stay on completely arbitrary and frivolous grounds. The companies have been adopting a completely mischievous, unethical and inhumane approach while considering the request for cashless facility of Covid patients over hospital stay by furnishing super-medical advice, over and above the advice rendered by the medical experts, on the necessity of hospitalisation of patients,” he said.The discretion of placing a patient in-home quarantine or hospitalisation lies solely with the doctors and medical experts examining or screening the patients and not with the insurance companies, the applicant said, adding, patients have been advised hospitalisation based on the previous medical history and co-morbidities after they consulted hospitals or doctors on receipt of Covid-19 positive reports. “However, the claims are unilaterally and mischievously rejected by the insurance companies stating that the patient did not need to go to the hospital, in a brazen display of high-handedness and apathy,” the application read.The degree of lung infection, comorbidities and age of the patient “are considered for admitting a patient to the hospital and the patient is not in a position to either accept or deny such advice of the doctors to get admitted. The pandemic has shown that private healthcare is unaffordable, public healthcare is weak and insurance is not helping people access healthcare either,” Inamdar added.Despite instructions from IRDA, the applicant said the Insurance companies have been denying cashless facilities to patients. The process of reimbursement has also become a terrible and tiresome affair, wherein medical refund is available after unfair and unreasonable deductions, which went up to 40% to 50% of the actual bill amount.“Any medical opinion by the insurance companies to deny the claims contrary to the opinion of the doctors or the hospitals suggesting hospitalisation is entirely untenable, illegal and in denial of the claim of the policyholders clearly amounts to profiteering, extortion and unjust enrichment,” he said.He added, “In case there is even an inkling of the hospitals’ complicity with the insurance companies to squeeze or extort money by abusing the trust, misery and misfortune of Covid-19 patients, in a racket of sorts to unlawfully extort more and more money, it is imperative that a committee be constituted to inquire into the matter and unearth the truth.”The court has fixed the hearing on the matter after three weeks."

Delhi Traffic police said the project is nearing completion and traffic will reduce gradually.The bottleneck is due to the construction of a pedestrian subway across Aurobindo Marg, between Dilli Haat and entry number 4 of East Kidwai Nagar. Workers at the site said that the construction has been going on for months and is now nearing completion. A major part of the main road has been barricaded, leaving little space for vehicles to pass.The project began on October 27 last year and was scheduled for completion by August 26 this year. However, the project had been stalled because of the lockdown and the labour shortage that ensued.A traffic police officer said, “Traffic from other areas has been diverted to this area because of construction work on Barapullah phase 3. Hence, there are more vehicles passing INA at the moment. The subway is nearing completion, only a little work is left.”He added that once work on 3-4 projects, including DND-Ashram extension, is complete, the situation will be much better. “Traffic in South Delhi will reduce significantly over the course of the next few months,” he said."

Malik has been with Karl since 2014 and married him in 2019.Malik, in the petition filed through advocate Fuzail Ahmad Ayyubi, submitted that she and her husband are YouTube vloggers who have visited most parts of the country to capture its beauty, and thereby, contribute to promotion of tourism in India. “The petitioner, by virtue of denial of a visa to her husband who has been arbitrarily blacklisted by the Respondents, is deprived from living with her husband thereby violating her fundamental right to life and dignity as guaranteed under Article 21,” she argued in the plea.Karl has dual nationality of New Zealand and Netherlands. He has been visiting India since 2013, and, subsequent to his marriage with Malik, was granted a visa meant for the spouse of an Indian citizen. One of the visa conditions required him to exit the country every 180 days or intimate the Foreigner Regional Registration Office for extension.“Complying with the aforesaid condition of exiting the nation, while the petitioner’s husband left India on 10.10.2020, he has not been able to return because any application for issuance of an Indian visa is being rejected by the Respondents. While the petitioner has been running from pillar to post and no reasons are communicated to either Mr Karl Edward Rice or to the petitioner herself as to on what basis her husband’s request for issuance of visa have been rejected, the petitioner’s husband was only verbally informed that he has been blacklisted and therefore he is not permitted to enter into India,” Malik said in the petition.Justice Rekha Palli on Friday told the Centre there has to be justifiable reasons for the blacklisting, and the reasons have to be communicated to either Karl or his wife. The court granted three weeks time to the respondents to file a counter-affidavit, and listed the case for hearing on September 23.Advocate Anurag Ahluwalia, representing the authorities, submitted to the court that Karl has been blacklisted for visa violations as, despite being on a spouse visa, was conducting business in India. Ahluwalia sought time to file a reply to the plea.When Ayyubi, representing Malik, sought a short date for next hearing in the case, the court said, “It is all right. You have been out in October. In Covid, people are not seeing their family for more than one year… so it is all right.”“Have a little patience. If you are in the right, you will succeed,” added the court.Karl was praised by Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in 2020 for donating plasma at a government plasma bank."

July 16, 2021 11:34:04 amThe detection was made possible by uGMRT, a unique and the most sensitive instrument operating best in the frequency range between 300 MegaHertz and 1000 MegaHertz — where low frequency gravitational waves get detected.",https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/pulsars-detect-space-weather-disruptions-7407354/,"For the first time, space weather disruptions triggered by the sun were measured using pulsars with the help of the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) in Pune.Usually weighing 1.5 times more than the sun, pulsars are massive stars which rotate at a very high speed (upto 600 rotations per minute) and emit periodic radio flashes. Pulsars are considered the most accurate clocks in the universe and scientists accurately predict their flashes.Using uGMRT, astronomers record pulsar radio flashes once every 14 days and it was during one such observation in February 2019 that they chanced upon Coronal Mass Ejection (CME). One such disruption, resultant CME, was confirmed based on the abnormally-delayed radio signals received from PSRJ2145 – 0750, the pulsar source under uGMRT observation, on February 23, 2019.CMEs — wave streams containing charged particles and plasma — emerge from the sun and possess a great potential to disrupt space weather, affect satellite, telecommunications and power grids on Earth.“The pulsar signal observed from this source on the following day, that is, February 24, was noted to have a delay of about six times higher than what occurs normally. This excess delay was caused due to the highly electrically charged medium — present between the earth and the sun — which was a result of the CME event from the previous day,” said Prof Bhal Chandra Joshi, senior scientist at the TIFR — National Centre for Radio Astrophysics, Pune, who was a part of the study published recently in the journal of Astronomy and Astrophysics.Gravitational wave (in higher frequencies) detections were first confirmed using the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) in 2016.However, 20 astronomers associated with the Indian Pulsar Timing Array (InPTA) from Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, IIT-Roorkee, IIT-Hyderabad, Institute of Mathematical Sciences and Raman Research Institute — have now detected low-frequency gravitational waves for the first time with the help of these pulsar signals.The detection was made possible by uGMRT, a unique and the most sensitive instrument operating best in the frequency range between 300 MegaHertz and 1000 MegaHertz — where low frequency gravitational waves get detected. As radio signals from pulsars change as they pass through low frequency gravitational waves, their discovery is now confirmed.Scientists say that when gravitational waves approach earth, there is either an advancement or delay by a tiny measure, of the order of a few tens of microseconds, in this pulsar beam signal arriving over earth.“We are aware of the standard delays in the arrival of the radio signals from the pulsar but since the signal from PSRJ2145 – 0750 arrived beyond this acceptable delay, it got scientists thinking. Other satellite observations confirmed a medium intensity CME on February 23, 2019,” added Joshi.The InPTA astronomers further stated that solar cycles and sun’s activity, either the maximum (solar activity is at its peak) or the minima (solar activity is at its lowest point) will now have to be factored in while studying pulsars.This as any change in the composition of the medium triggered by CMEs can also lead to deterioration in the accuracy of predicting radio flashes from the pulsars, they said."

Soon after the transactions, the businessman received a phone call from his credit card company that was tracking his transactions and he was asked to immediately approach the local police station in order to recover the money. A Khar police official confirmed the registration of an FIR in the matter and said efforts were being made to recover the money.The incident took place at around 7 pm on July 12 when the businessman searched Google and got the number of Francisco pizza places. The businessman did not know that many fraudsters give their own numbers on Google as a number of popular brands, customer services to dupe unsuspecting customers.The businessman called up on the number and the fraudster said he will call back from another number. Another fraudster personating as the manager called back and asked him to send an advance payment and sent him a link. The businessman filled in the details on the link and received an OTP. Soon after sharing the OTP, Rs 20,000 got debited from his account. The businessman questioned the fraudster as to how such a big amount got deducted just for a pizza.But the fraudster apologized and said it happened by mistake and he would return the money and asked for another OTP. The businessman again shared the OTP and again Rs 20,000 got debited from his account. The fraudster somehow convinced the businessman that it was a technical error and made him send the OTP two more times and a total of Rs 65,000 got debited from his account. Soon after the fourth transaction, the credit card company called him and asked him if he was making the payments. When the businessman denied it, the company official asked him to approach the local police to lodge a complaint. The Khar police have lodged an FIR and a probe is on to find the accused."

They suspect their personal information was leaked from the office after their notice was published on a board there and on the government website.The Khar police has promised to ensure no further harassment to the couple or their families. Vasant Pingle, Assistant Commissioner of Police of Khar Police Station told The Indian Express, “We have warned the men not to bother the woman’s family. We have also provided the woman with the number of our police officer in case she faces any further trouble.”In order to ensure such incidents do not repeat in future, two organisations — the Citizens of Justice and Peace (CJP), a human rights movement, and Dhanak of Humanity, a non-profit organisation founded by interfaith couples — have written a letter to Kunte asking him to ensure that the January 8, 2021 order of the Allahabad HC is implemented.On behalf of CJP, activist Teesta Setalvad told The Indian Express, “We first took up the issue in January by writing a letter to then chief secretary Sanjay Kumar, but no action was taken. After this incident, we wrote to Kunte on July 14 asking him to implement the Allahabad HC order in the matter of Safiya Sultana v. State of Uttar Pradesh [Habeas Corpus No. – 16907], delivered on January 12, 2021, by the Hon’ble Allahabad High Court, in response to a habeas corpus writ petition which contended that the requirement to publish a notice of intended marriage for 30 days as well as the ability of any person to object to the intended union as stated by Sections 5, 6 and 7 of The Special Marriage Act, 1954, respectively, was an invasion of privacy and would cause unnecessary social pressure/interference in their free choice with regard to their marriage.”Setalvad added, “It is also important to note that the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in Kusum Ingots & Alloys v. Union of India [(2004) 6 SCC 254] mandated that ‘an order passed on a writ petition questioning the constitutionality of a parliamentary Act, whether interim or final keeping in view the provisions contained in clause (2) of Article 226 of the Constitution of India, will have effect throughout the territory of India subject of course to the applicability of the Act’.”"

But we have also found evidence of later habitation, even up to 8-9th century AD,” says Banani Bhattacharyya, Deputy Director of Haryana Archaeology & Museums Department. “It can be said that this may be one of the biggest Palaeolithic sites in the Indian sub-continent, where stone age tools were recovered from open-air sites as well as from rock shelters,” she added.The cave paintings first came to light in May this year when an environmental activist, Sunil Harsana, spotted them in Mangarbani hill forest in the Faridabad district of Haryana. It prompted the Haryana Archeology department to conduct exploration in Shilakhari, Mangar, Kot, and Dhauj of Faridabad district and Roj ka Gujjar and Damdama of Gurgaon district in June this year.The officials now say that it is for the first time that a prehistoric site, along with cave paintings and rock art of a large magnitude, has been found in Haryana, though tools from the Palaeolithic Age have already been identified in parts of Aravallis. The latest discovery, the officials say, will change the history of Haryana and take it further back in time. “The cave paintings are yet to be dated but at least some of them belong to the Upper Palaeolithic period in all likelihood,” says an official.The Upper Paleolithic Age began around 40,000 years ago and lasted till around 10,000 years ago.Sources say the area concerned is not a protected site and it has not been properly documented or explored yet. However, Haryana Principal Secretary, Ashok Khemka, says, “We will give state protection to Mangarbani forests under the Ancient and Historical Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1964, because of the presence of a large number of stone age sites with cave paintings and tools of the Paleolithic Age that have been found there.”"
19,"Hooda cites NSSO figures, economic survey as Khattar trashes CMIE data
July 16, 2021 10:17:00 amHooda claimed that Haryana had an unemployment rate of only 2.8 percent during his tenure as CM and it “now has increased to 27.9 per cent”.",https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chandigarh/hooda-nsso-figures-economic-survey-khattar-cmie-data-7407250/,"The ongoing war of words between Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar and his predecessor Bhupinder Singh Hooda over unemployment rate intensified Thursday with the Opposition leader laying out the NSSO data and the Economic Survey figures to claim that the BJP-JJP government in state was in a denial mode on joblessness.“Chief Minister may try to run down data collected by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), but data from the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) – under Union Ministry of Statistics and Programme – also indicates that unemployment has turned into a crisis in Haryana. The latest Economic Survey of the state government shows that 8,81,679 people had registered for jobs, of which only 2,816 got employment. The NSSO data, released after the Lok Sabha elections, showed that the unemployment record of 45 years was broken during the BJP government. When the country had an unemployment rate of 6.1 per cent, Haryana’s was 8.6 per cent – higher than backward states like UP, Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh,” Hooda said.The Leader of Opposition was reacting to Khattar’s statement a day ago trashing the CMIE data. “The Leader of the Opposition refers to a report of an institution which doesn’t have any credibility. According to the March 2020 report of the National Statistical Organization, the unemployment rate in Haryana was seven per cent, between January and March, 2020, while the CMIE report showed it to be 23.7 per cent. Therefore, the rhetoric being made by Hooda on increase in unemployment rate is false and baseless,” Khattar had said.Hooda, however, claimed that Haryana had an unemployment rate of only 2.8 percent during his tenure as CM and it “now has increased to 27.9 per cent”. He said that six years ago, the government had organized an investment summit in Gurgaon. “It was claimed that MoUs worth Rs 5.87 lakh crore have been signed but no investment is visible on the ground. No new project, no big industry and no employment was created. Government should tell what happened to those MoUs,” the Congress leader said.Further targeting Khattar, he said, “At least 18 to 20 lakh educated youth had applied for recruitment when the government had released vacancies for 18,000 fourth class jobs. Not only this, about 25 lakh youth had applied when the government had released recruitment for 6,000 clerk posts. In the past, about 7000 youth had applied for just 10 posts of peons in Jagadhri court and 14,871 had applied for the raw recruitment of 13 posts of peons in Panipat court. Candidates holding BA, MA, MSc, MCom, M.Phil and PhD degrees from across the state are also applying for temporary posts of peons where the minimum qualification is class eight. But it is surprising that the government is not ready to accept that unemployment has taken a frightening form in Haryana”.The Congress leader also accused the state government of misleading people about the airport near Meham and Sonepat Rail Coach Factory. “The Rail Coach Factory, which was approved for Sonipat during the Congress tenure, has been shifted to another state. At present, only a small repair centre is being built here. We had worked hard to get clearance after doing all the formalities like the location of the international airport, but the BJP also let the project go to another state. Huge projects worth thousands of crores were moved from Haryana to other states and the Haryana government remained silent,” he said.Talking about the rising prices of petrol and diesel, Hooda said, there is a lot of anger among people. “The prices of most items of daily consumption are increasing and the common man is suffering, but the government is silent,” he said.Hooda claimed that the Centre does not want to reduce the excise duty on petroleum products and the state government does not want to give any relief to people by lowering the VAT, which is double of what it was during the previous Congress regime.The Congress, meanwhile, held statewide protests against the hike in prices of fuel, cooking gas and other essential commodities. State Congress chief Kumari Selja, who led the protest in Gurgaon, where she was joined by senior leader Ajay Singh Yadav, said the steep rise in the fuel prices is bound to burden the common people who are already facing hardships due to the Covid-19 pandemic."

The bench said, “List this petition of which one of us (Arun Palli, J.) is not a member on July 23.”The petitioner, Dinesh Chadha, through counsel, advocate Sameer Sachdeva, has sought directions against the “illegal, fraudulent and treacherous acts committed by the state Government officials in connivance with state Cabinet Minister for Sports and Youth Affairs, Gurmeet Singh, whereby the land of minister and his family which stood acquired and compensation paid in 1962, was again mischievously acquired in 2012 by the state government for same very purpose by sheer manipulations and widespread bungling, leading to double payment of compensation for the same very land twice to the minister and his family by defrauding the state exchequer and public at large”. The petitioner submitted that “the entire wrong committed against the state and public at large needs to be undone by the High Court by declaring the second acquisition proceedings and all related proceedings as illegal, null and void-abinitio”.The PIL could mean more trouble for the state government, which is already facing crisis due to infighting in the ruling party. The Cabinet minister, against whom the PIL has been filed, is considered a close aide of Chief Minister Amarinder Singh.The petitioner, Dinesh Chadha from Punjab’s Ropar area, claimed that the case involved a matter of “grave public concern, whereby a present Cabinet minister in Punjab government managed and manipulated the government machinery in taking compensation again and again for the same land, in the garb of dual acquisition proceedings by concealing the facutm of earlier acquisition proceedings. Now when the entire scam and fraud is unearthed as per the state government’s own high power committee report, the state government officials are sitting as puppets and helpless creatures in the hand of mighty and powerful, least they will themselves be facing the wrath in case they dare to take any criminal action against the minister concerned and his family members”.The State of Punjab acquired 12 acres belonging to the minister and his family in 1962 for the construction of Ferozpur-Fazilika road. The family accepted the compensation but in 2000 by “taking advantage of old revenue entries, the minister with an intention to defraud the government of Punjab and also mislead the court, filed the suit to take possession of the land that the state acquired in 1962. In 2007, for the lack of averment on the part of the government officials, the suit was decreed in favour of the minister”, claimed the petitioner, while adding that there was no serious effort to challenge it in higher courts.In 2008, the minister filed a writ petition praying that he was not given compensation for the acquisition. On High Court direction, the then superintendent engineer, “without examining the record properly took a decision to re-acquire the land, following which the State awarded compensation amounting to Rs 1.83 crore”.In 2015, the minister concerned, as per the petitioner, did not stop here as he filed the petition for re-determination of the acquisition compensation. The application was disposed of vide order November 26, 2015, thereby allowing the application for re-determination of the amount of compensation as per the new act, 2013.The petitioner has claimed that the Punjab government in 2020 formed a committee under the chairmanship of the chief secretary to verify the facts with regard to the “bogus exercise” being conducted, “leading to the same piece of land belonging to the minister being acquired twice”. Now the minister was seeking release of further compensation through contempt proceedings.In LPA 126 of 2021 dated February 9, 2021, the division bench stayed the contempt orders filed by the minister for not following the re-determination of the land compensation passed by additional session judge in 2015, appreciating the plea of the State acknowledging the fraud in this case. Even though the high-powered committee of the state government submitted a report in this regard, no action has been taken so far, claimed the petitioner."

It aimed at banning all forms of cattle slaughter by recommending stringent penalties for violators. The Bill was shelved in 2013 by the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government after it failed to get the Governor’s assent.The Congress had then reverted to the Karnataka Prevention of Cow Slaughter and Preservation of Animals Act, 1964, which banned the killing of any cow or calf of she-buffalo. However, it had certain relaxations, like allowing the slaughter of bullock, buffalo-male or female if it was certified by a competent authority to be above the age of 12 years, incapacitated for breeding or deemed sick.The Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Bill, 2020 proposes a maximum of seven years imprisonment and a fine of Rs 5 lakh for the offenders. It seeks a total ban on the slaughter of cows in the state, and provides for stringent punishment to those who indulge in smuggling, illegal transportation, atrocities on cows and slaughtering them."

At any rate, the earmarked amount of about Rs 133 crore has to be disbursed and if it is discovered that the number of persons with disabilities is substantially less than the 13.35 lakh figure that is shown in the database, it will only permit such earmarked sum to be distributed to the lesser number of persons with disabilities such that each person receives substantially more than Rs 1,000,” the Bench said."

The state cannot indulge in such things. Development has to be sustainable,” the bench said and asked government counsel to file within three weeks, a status report on the issue from TNRDC.According to the petitioner, the water sources in his village were being obliterated due to the project.While the TNRDC had protected the water bodies in Kelambakkam village by constructing bridges at appropriate places, it has chosen to construct the expressway right on the water bodies in Padur, which was inhabited by more than 20,000 families dependent on those water bodies.Even the cattle and the birds had been deprived of the water sources.He claimed that the civil contractors engaged by TNRDC had destroyed the Kalleri lake and Padur pond, which were home to fish, snails and other living organisms.The two water bodies were now filled with debris. The groundwater table in Padur had gone down from 80 ft in 2006 to 200 ft now.He urged the court to declare the encroachment of water bodies as ‘illegal’ and order their restoration besides initiating action against the erring officials.Meanwhile, hearing a separate petition, the bench permitted the state government to use GPS and drone technology to take accurate surveys of waterways and water bodies in Tamil Nadu.“It may be a worthwhile exercise to use various modes, including the GPS technology together with the drone photography on the one hand and physical survey on the other, if only to have accurate details of the topography and the nature of the space on ground that can be dated,” it said.This may not only help the revenue, but may also be a guide for the Town and Country Planning authorities, be a reference point for environmental impact assessment or a regular reference for specialised bodies as the Pollution Control Boards, the National Green Tribunal and the like, the bench added.The PIL questioned the beautification of Perumpallam Odai in Erode under the Smart City Mission with more than Rs 100 crore of central financing."

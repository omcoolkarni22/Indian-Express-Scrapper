The actor died on Friday after suffering a cardiac arrest.",https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif,https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/television/balika-vadhu-anandi-jagya-avika-gor-avinash-mukerjee-on-surekha-sikri-love-you-dadisa-7407453/,"Veteran actor Surekha Sikri passed away on Friday, following a cardiac arrest. With a career spanning more than four decades, she had built a niche for herself. A member of NSD Repertory, she went on to create magic in front of the camera. Be it in films like Tamas, Zubeidaa and more recently Badhaai Ho, to television shows like Banegi Apni Baat, Saat Phere and Just Mohabbat, Surekha Sikri’s characters stood out. One role on the small screen that made her a household name continues to be from Balika Vadhu, where she played the stern matriarch Kalyani Devi.As the industry and her fans bid her a last farewell, her Balika Vadhu co-star remembered their Maa sa and Dadisa, and said that it was nothing short of an honour to have shared the screen with her.Avinash Mukherjee, who played the young Jagya, in the daily show shared that while he hadn’t been in touch with her lately, she continues to be an inspiration for him. In an exclusive chat with indianexpress.com, the 23-year-old said, “She is one of the greatest actors we have in the world. She was always very disciplined and dedicated towards her work. I sometimes still go back to watching old clips from Balika Vadhu just to get an understanding of the quality of acting she managed to do on camera.”  A post shared by Indian Express Entertainment (@ieentertainment) The Sasural Simar Ka 2 actor played her grandson on the show, and they shared the same bond off-screen. “I was her laadesar in real life,” he said, remembering her time with the veteran actor. Avinash went on to share, how he as a nine-year-old had once tried to quiz Surekha Sikri. “I was so innocent. One day on the set, out of the blue I questioned her – ‘how do you act so well?’ She gracefully replied and said ‘experience’. It’s just so sad that God is taking away our biggest heroes. After Dilip saab, now Surekha ji.”Avinash Mukherjee went on to share an anecdote about the time Surekha Sikri lost her husband. Her dedication towards work set an example for him. “In 2009, her husband passed away. She got the news at lunch break and left the set. The next morning, at 7 am, she was ready with her dialogues all dressed up. Everyone was shocked at seeing her at work, and she went on to perform with a line of hesitation. I think that requires a different level of dedication and passion for one’s work. I learnt that as actors, one has to keep their personal emotions aside when they come on set. That work ethic stayed with me and I keep telling the same to my co-stars too.”Avika Gor, who played young Anandi on Balika Vadhu, wrote on Instagram, “I have some amazing memories with Surekha ji. Apart from being an incredible actress she was a beautiful human. It was always difficult to match her energy levels during the scenes but she made sure I was comfortable every time I was around her & that taught me to be grounded. I have always wanted to be like her.. hardworking.. grounded.. kind❤️. She has truly left us a legacy to follow. Dadisaa… I will always love you, my guardian angel. RIP💔.”  A post shared by Avika Gor (@avikagor) For actor Annup Sonii, working with Surekha Sikri was special, given they both came from the National School of Drama. While she passed long before he went to the college, Annup said that she was quite popular at NSD, and continues to be. “I would keep hearing about how amazing an actor she was, and it piqued my interest. I had even seen her pictures in the campus and people would always talk highly of her. After I passed out, I remember watching her in Banegi Apni Baat and even Mammo, and got to witness her prowess. And then of course, we got a chance to work together in Balika Vadhu,” he mentioned.In the show, the actor played Surekha Sikri’s son Bhairon Singh and the actor shared that their on-screen relationship seemed very real to viewers. “I remember, even when I would be with friends, having a drink, they would pull my leg, saying Maa sa will scold you,” the actor said with a laugh.Sonii further shared that the entire team had been in touch with her and was even calling each other since the news of her demise came in. Talking about his time spent on the set, the actor said that apart from a good script, having Surekha Sikri around helped the entire cast to give their best. “I think the quality of the show and performance of every actor was an effect of a good working environment. We had this senior actor, who never took her work casually, even on a daily show, and that kept the passion alive in others too. I remember, Surekha ji, me and Satyajeet Sharma, who was also an NSD pass-out, would spend hours talking about the institution and we would keep asking her about her time on the campus. It was such a wonderful time, and I believe it was an honour to have worked with her for six years.”Post the leap, Shashank Vyas took charge as the grown-up Jagdish aka Jagya. Having worked more than five years with Surekha Sikri, Vyas cannot thank his stars to have shared the screen with the thespian. Stating that he feels she must have done something good in life, he said, “Getting a chance to work with her and learn so much in five years seems like a reward for my past good deeds. She was an institution in herself and a legendary natural actor. Surekha ji was so full of life and positivity. She lived life on her own terms and had an amazing sense of humour. We both shared a very close bond, and I will keep that close to my heart forever.”Three-times national award winner Surekha Sikri, 75, was ailing for a long time and had suffered two brain strokes in 2020 and 2018. She was last seen in Netflix anthology Ghost Stories in the section helmed by Zoya Akhtar."

The book comes with anecdotes, advice and how her family and friends were her allies as she brought her sons to the world.The introduction of the book, written by Kareena, has been released and it talks about the actor trying to balance it all – her work commitments, motherhood and thanking all the help she gets from her own mother, Babita, and her domestic staff.Kareena has also spoken about the role of her mother-in-law, Sharmila Tagore, who pushed her to get back to work as soon as she can, and how husband Saif Ali Khan was a big support to her.  A post shared by Kareena Kapoor Khan (@kareenakapoorkhan)In the excerpt, Kareena has written, “My mother-in-law was also among the first to tell me that I had to keep working. Her advice was to do whatever I wanted but with confidence. She did some great work in the movies after her marriage and kids and was a real inspiration. My mother is also a strong role model for me, and she and my father both told me I must keep at it. So I thought what the heck! I plunged headlong into not one but two pregnancies and I now have these two tots in my life who make every day feel a little crazy, a little special, a little exhausting, and a little rewarding.”  A post shared by Kareena Kapoor Khan (@kareenakapoorkhan)Kareena also wrote about how she has been acing her work-life balance. She wrote, “And so here I am – writing these words, working, being a mommy, being active, being real. You know, my life often feels like the tree pose – where you’re balancing on one leg. I think women do that beautifully.”Kareena also credited Saif Ali Khan for being a strong support in her life. She shares, “But Saif told me I could do it all. He and I have worked hard to build a strong foundation for our relationship, and I truly believe my kids will always have that to stand on. And, hopefully, Jeh will be as confident as Taimur, because of his parents.”Saif Ali Khan has written the afterword of the book.Kareena had earlier posted about her book on Instagram where she wrote, “This has been quite the journey… both my pregnancies and writing my Pregnancy Bible. There were good days and bad days; some days I was raring to go to work and others where I struggled to get out of bed. This book is a very personal account of what I experienced both physically and emotionally through both my pregnancies.”On the work front, Kareena was last seen in Good Newzzz (2019) with Akshay Kumar, Diljit Dosanjh and Kiara Advani. She will soon be seen in Laal Singh Chaddha alongside Aamir Khan."

The page faced a severe backlash for Sanjana‘s post where she spoke about how she has been helping her domestic staff during the pandemic and also got them vaccinated. She also spoke about how her staff was very helpful to her during the pandemic, and now she is returning the favour. This piece with Sanjana was reportedly a promoted collaboration with a beer brand.Just hours after the HOB post went live on their social media platforms, Diet Sabya called out the post, highlighting how HOB and Sanjana have ended up using her three domestic workers as props to improve her own image. Diet Sabya is a sharp-tongued anonymous Instagram account dedicated to exposing imitations or appropriations, even blatant copies, in fashion.As Diet Sabya put out the story about Sanjana’s post, many Instagram users started reacting and demanded that the HOB post should be taken down as it appeared to use Sanjana’s domestic staff to earn praise for her.Diet Sabya, while calling out the actor on their Instagram stories, wrote, “’Help’ suggests that they are doing charity/pro-bono work out of the kindness of their heart.’Workers’ suggests that they are getting paid for their service. They deserve all rights that any employee would get.”Here’s how netizens reacted to Diet Sabya’s post:Many also reacted by saying, “This post reeked of privilege and self importance through and through.” Some also felt that Sanjana’s domestic workers didn’t get anything out of their faces being shown all over the internet, whereas Sanjana got more praise and apparently got paid for telling the story too.”After the backlash that the Humans of Bombay received on featuring Sanjana Sanghi’s story, the platform has now taken down the story. An official statement from the actor is awaited.On the work front, Sanjana was last seen sharing screen space with late actor Sushant Singh Rajput in Mukesh Chhabra’s 2020 film, Dil Bechara. Her next film is Kapil Verma’s Om: The Battle Within, also starring Aditya Roy Kapur."

This is the first solid proof that multiverse is a reality in MCU.",https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif,https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/web-series/loki-new-video-how-tom-hiddleston-show-has-changed-mcu-forever-7407246/,"A featurette from Loki titled ‘Future’ has teased that the show has changed MCU forever. The sixth episode of the show, or rather its first season, became available to watch on Wednesday. It ended the season on a cliffhanger.The show can be credited for introducing the multiverse to MCU. It actually made up the crux of the show’s story and drove the central conflict. The show has also confirmed that it would return for a second season, which is likely to happen at the end of next year.Loki was captured by the Time Variance Authority or the TVA for the very crime of being a variant — a being who did something that was not supposed to happen. While the Loki we knew in MCU is dead after being strangled by Thanos, the one that headlined the show is the Loki who escaped with the Tesseract or Space Stone after the Battle of New York.After being arrested by the TVA, he learns that the organisation is hunting for a variant of his — or his version from another universe. It turns out to be a female Loki who calls herself Sylvie.Loki teamed up with Sylvie and the two eventually found themselves in the Void, a place at the end of time. There, they discovered more Loki variants, which as, um, as varied, as a kid and an alligator.Loki is the first solid proof that multiverse is a reality in MCU. That, and the presence of Jonathan Majors’ He Who Remains or Kang the Conqueror in the Citadel at the End of Time and interesting ramifications for MCU’s future.First, with the multiverse, Marvel Studios can explain the arrival of X-Men (including Ryan Reynolds’ Deadpool) and Fantastic Four in the MCU. It would be an easy avenue for the Marvel properties that Disney acquired when it bought Fox to introduce to MCU. At any rate, it would be simpler to do than saying they existed in MCU all along and we just never saw them.Second, Kang the Conqueror possesses temporal domains and this will play into the story of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, where we will see a more evil variant of He Who Remains.Thirdly, the stage is set for the multiverse madness that the third Doctor Strange has promised us.Whatever happens, things are going to be infinitely more exciting in the Marvel Cinematic Universe than they have ever been."

6,"Malik: A Nayakan-like story narrated in the Citizen Kane mould July 16, 2021  10:24:07 amThe premise of Malik is very close to Mani Ratnam's classic Nayakan -- an existentialist hero who goes back and forth between his identity as a hero and a villain.",https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif,https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/opinion-entertainment/malik-a-nayakan-like-story-narrated-in-the-citizen-kane-mold-7405837/,"Sulaiman Ali Ahammad is no ordinary criminal. He is a man of principle who, even when he steps on the wrong side of law, will always hold his moral code close. He takes on corruption without worrying about the price he may have to pay or the friends he may lose. But when doling out justice, he is as dispassionate and hard as those he is up against.Malayalam hit Malik sets up Fahadh Faasil’s Sulaiman as a Godfather-like figure, who delivers his own version of justice on his native Ramadappally. The film is the third collaboration between Fahadh and Mahesh Narayanan after Take Off and C U soon. And by default, the expectations from this film were obviously high, given the last two films of the actor-director duo were such a hit. And Malik lives up to the expectations.The film zeroes in on the hero who takes to crime for the collective good of the people of his coastal village. While he is celebrated as a hero in Ramadappally, the people in power see him as nuisance who needs to be taken out of play. Sulaiman stands in the way of greedy politicians taking over control of a coveted land near the coast. The politicians enlist the service of cops to take him out of the equation by bringing a 20-year-old case back to life. He is arrested under TADA act, and thus begins a race against time. While Sulaiman’s friends work around the clock to keep him alive in jail, cops and politicians bend over backwards to have him killed before his remand period is over. Will Sulaiman survive the prison? Will Sulaiman’s good deeds protect him from his enemies? And the age-old question: does the end justify the means? But, perhaps the most important one, who’s Sulaiman?Each frame is packed with a lot of information, activities and clues that contribute to the audience’s understanding of Sulaiman’s legend. Mahesh even gives a mythological edge to Sulaiman as his mother recalls the story of how he defeated death when he was just a child.Malik is technically very sound. Mahesh and his cinematographer Sanu Varghese have composed elaborate shots, which play like a relay race. So is the editing, which is also done by Mahesh as the narration seamlessly jumps back and forth in time. Malik is so dense with various storytelling techniques that one may have to watch it at least twice before one can grasp all of its layers.The premise of Malik is very close to Mani Ratnam’s classic Nayakan — an existentialist hero, who goes back and forth between his identity as a hero and a villain. While Kamal Haasan’s Velu is tormented by this question, Sulaiman is unburdened by his sense of responsibility. In a way, he has no regrets about his actions. He leaves that decision for the almighty to make. The question that keeps him up at night is whether he should continue as a mob boss or give up his life of crime and follow the path of religion.Nayakan takes a linear approach and we see the protagonist’s life as it happens. Malik, however, reveals Sulaiman’s life through the memories of the character who knows him. Mahesh uses a narrative style similar to that of Citizen Kane. Like the iconic film’s writer, Herman J. Mankiewicz famously said, “You cannot capture a man’s entire life in two hours. All you can hope is to leave the impression of one.” And in that respect, Mahesh does leave a solid impression of a man, whose personality is forged in an extremely bigoted, ungrateful and cruel environment.Malik is not simply a story about a good-hearted mob boss. The film has many layers. The film follows Sulaiman’s philosophical quest, his political views and how he sees all symbols of authority as an expression of oppression. He is ready to make personal sacrifices for the greater good. And, on the other hand, the well entrenched religious division that are used by the powerful to manipulate people’s will to their advantage.Mahesh’s brilliance also lies in the way he has structured the film. As a popular saying by filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard goes, “A story should have a beginning, a middle and an end, but not necessarily in that order.” The ending of Malik could be constructed as the beginning of a new chapter in a seemingly never-ending fight against oppression and the beginning of the film could be considered as an end of an old chapter. The beauty of Mahesh’s editing is this film would still be meaningful even if it is narrated backwards."

When we asked her looking back, how has been her 15-year-long Bollywood journey, she said, “It is very cumbersome and tiresome to look back. So, I don’t really look back. I just try to be here and look forward. Now what’s done is done. Even when things have been wonderful and fantastic for me, I am only looking forward to what is next. I have enjoyed myself, and I have got to be a part of some amazing films, play some incredible roles and work with the best people in the industry. But now I only look forward to what I want to do from here on.” Katrina had also opened up about how she wants to play more exciting roles in the future. “I want to be in places and on sets that give me a chance to play an exciting role. I think I have ticked most of the other boxes of what I wanted to do when I first started out as an actor. Even then I was very clear about what I wanted to do and the kind of films I wanted to do. I knew what I wanted to see myself as. And I was able to do all of that. Now it is all about what I want to do in the next phase of my career and life,” she had shared.  A post shared by Katrina Kaif (@katrinakaif)Katrina, who used to be seen as a glamorous Bollywood diva, has evolved as an actor, her performance in Shah Rukh Khan’s Zero (2018), is proof. On this, Katrina had shared that, for her growing as an actor and polishing her skill is of utmost importance to her. She had said, “I think it is wonderful. Growth is important in anyone’s life and in any profession you are in. You have to have growth and you have to evolve in someway. It is important how people saw my journey say from New York, Namaste London, Rajneeti and now if they look at my work differently say in Zero or Bharat. I am happy that I am growing in my profession.”  A post shared by Katrina Kaif (@katrinakaif)Katrina had debuted in Bollywood with Boom (2003). She is probably one of the few outsiders who has made a pretty enviable place for herself in the industry. She said she is not someone who enjoys revisiting her initial days, she had said, “No. Because if I do, then there is so much to think about. But yes, it does happen if I see something that I did when I first started out or when an ad or video clip from my initial work comes online. I laugh about it. When these things come up, I think about the head space that I was in and it all feels funny now. But over all, I have had a really really great time.”Katrina is now awaiting the release of her Rohit Shetty film Sooryavanshi, with Akshay Kumar. She has reportedly also started preparing for Tiger 3 with Salman Khan and has also started readings for Sriram Raghavan’s next with Vijay Sethupathi. The actor has done more than 40 films already. “I think I respond very instinctively to the scripts. When a director comes, they narrate a story and you respond to it. It is literally that simple. There is no preconceived thing in my head that now I will only do a period film, an action film or a comedy film. I will only respond to the story if it connects with me.”  A post shared by Katrina Kaif (@katrinakaif)On a parting note, Katrina candidly also shared what has been her biggest take away from love, life and work. She said, “It is all unpredictable. You will never know what is going to happen. So I believe in giving it my best and not to stress too much about the future. It is all about enjoying what is today and to try and do what I am doing now with the best of my ability.”  "

Toofaan movie director: Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra
Toofaan movie rating: 3.5 stars‘Toofaan’ is your underprivileged-underdog-to-boxing-champion tale whose arc is utterly predictable, but what makes this film such an enjoyable watch is the way it has been written and performed. You know exactly where it will go, but the journey pops with smart feints and jabs, and ends with a satisfying punch.Given the utter banality of recent Bollywood outings, I’d given up hope of meeting a well-done mainstream film where each familiar element is marinated just so. Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra doesn’t pull back from genre elements, but dresses them up with enough confidence and freshness for us to root for Aziz Ali aka Ajju Bhai, played with great brio by Farhan Akhtar.Our Dongri-ka-small-time-vasooli-bhai goes about doing ‘phoda-phodi’ (in regular Hindi, it would be ‘maar-peet’; basically, it amounts to beating up people unable to pay their rent or ‘hafta’, along with his loyal pal-cum-roommate (Hussain Dalal, very good, giving an edge to the standard BFF role). Akhtar starts with a little extra swagger and mumble, but soon settles into it, tight pants-belt-tee to the fore.From here on, you can see what’s coming up a mile off. A meet-cute with pretty local doctor Ananya (Mrunal Thakur, perky, likeable) will lead to, yes, a flutter of hearts. An encounter with tough, irascible coach Nana Prabhu (Paresh Rawal) will lead to Aziz being put through his paces, and reaching the ring, the hallowed place for all aspiring boxers.This is where writers Anjum Rajabali and Vijay Maurya (props to the latter for the dialogues, especially the rat-a-tat ‘tapori’ lines) begin inserting twists. Prabhu is a proud Hindu who is convinced that there’s no difference between ‘Dongri and Dubai’. Calling his uber-talented Musalmaan pupil an unstoppable ‘toofaan’ is one thing; embracing him as a person is unthinkable. The show-me-how-hard-you-can-work-and-then-we’ll-talk grouchy coach is such a tired trope, from ‘Rocky’ to ‘Million Dollar Baby’ to our own ‘Saala Khadoos’, but Paresh Rawal effortlessly freshens it and makes it his own. Mohan Agashe, as his constant companion and old friend who gently steers him towards another way of thinking, is a nice touch. The veteran actor can be a little underlined, but here he doesn’t put a foot wrong. A little girl shows up, and she is, thank the lord, not cutesy.There are a few things that stick in your craw. Here comes Aziz, beginning to learn the ropes, and here comes a primer: ‘boxing ek nasha hai; boxing mein six punches hotey hain’ etc and anon. Please, no. And then there are the songs. Too many songs, stuffed too close in the second half. Also, giving a character too much time to spew bigotry before he sees the light is a tricky business; actually, using the term ‘love jihad’ for Aziz and Ananya could well be the only thing true bigots may take away. And while it’s great to have leading men playing Muslim characters, I’m waiting for a brave Bollywood film that will break away from the poor-but-talented slumboy (Ranveer Singh in ‘Gully Boy’) type. Still, an Aziz-and-Ananya is a job well begun.It is Farhan as ‘Toofaan-the-new-Muhammad-Ali’ who is completely convincing, both as a novice who is a fast learner, and the dejected warhorse who comes up trumps. He’s worked with Mehra before, in ‘Bhaag Milkha Bhaag’, and while he looked every inch a runner, a few false notes were bound to creep in when you are trying to dramatize the life of a beloved sports icon (I still haven’t forgotten my dropped jaw at Farhan’s Milkha cavorting with an Australian blonde).As Toofaan, Farhan’s footwork is bang on, whether it is in the stroppy romance with a girl far removed from his station, the impressive glistening-muscles-straining-in-training scenes, the skilful jousting, complete with the spray of blood, rattled teeth and swollen eye, during the bouts. It is his game, and he is on top."

On the occasion, the actors and the makers got together for a table read on Zoom. They also reminisced special moments from the film. For instance, we learned that Katrina Kaif was terrified during the diving scene, though in the film, she is just the opposite as she played the calm and composed diving instructor.Hrithik, on the other hand, saw the diving scene as ‘the film in one moment’, where his character Arjun emerges from the sea after conquering his fears. Speaking about the moment, he said, “For me, that was the entire film in one moment. Right from the time I heard the script, till we shot it, it was the target—it was the moment I was striving to reach. There were no words. Zoya was able to communicate the abstract into my mind. There was no real explanation. It was just something you understood, or you did not. I understood the moment, and it was beautiful on paper. We tried a lot of takes, but something was going wrong.”Finally, Hrithik Roshan decided to get into the water. “The water was freezing, and I was protecting myself from the cold. So I was pretending to come out of it. The shot starts with me on the ladder of the boat. Finally, I said that’s what is making me hold back. I am not allowing myself to be impacted by the water. In the final take, I just went in. Zoya said, ‘Are you sure? The water is really cold!’ I froze. I came out, and it was exactly what that moment needed.”Katrina Kaif added, “I was terrified. Everyone else were semi-pro divers. When we were shooting that underwater sequence where Hrithik has that epiphany, what actually was happening was that I was digging my nails into his hand because I was so scared. It was my first diving experience, like that.”The team also laughed over the song “Ik Junoon”, where they all danced at the Tomatina festival. Hrithik Roshan recalled, “I didn’t have tomatoes for three or four months. None of us could tolerate the presence of a tomato after that song. The kind of smell that we suffered!”"

The film is a sports drama starring Farhan Akhtar as a national level boxer.",https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif,https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/mrunal-thakur-on-acting-with-farhan-akhtar-in-toofaan-every-bollywood-actress-is-going-to-be-jealous-of-me-7405363/,"Mrunal Thakur has had a fantastic journey as a Bollywood actor. The 28-year-old actress, who made her acting debut with Love Sonia in 2018, will be seen in National Award-winning filmmaker Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra’s Toofaan opposite Farhan Akhtar. In this interview with indianexpress.com, Mrunal talks about her aim as an actor and why she prefers to stay away from the glam route.Excerpts from the interview:Toofaan is the quintessential underdog film, how was your experience working on the film?It is an iconic movie, at least in my career so far. To be a part of this movie itself is the biggest achievement in my life. I’ll say that because working with Farhan, Rakeysh sir and Paresh ji, Supriya Pathak, Hussain sir, Vijay Raaz and Mohan Agashe is an experience in itself. I could feel the life they brought into their characters. I just kept seeing how great they were at what they do and how they made this journey feel so real. I just felt that I was watching a slice of life. It made me realise that you don’t always have to act, ait is important is that you also feel. Toofaan has taught me that getting ready, getting your hair and make-up done doesn’t cut it. That’s not how you’re ready to act, you have feel the moment that you are in.Working with Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra is like a dream come true. I have learnt so many techniques, there is a way of dealing with a scene. I believe that conversation is a must, and that is what he does. Before the scene, he doesn’t rehearse the lines, he has that conversation with me, allows me to feel the situation.Farhan, meanwhile, has ignited that fire in me as an artiste, as a performer. He makes sure that whatever he does, he dives deep into it and performs as if there is no tomorrow. As an artiste, all the inhibitions I had, probably died with this one. He made sure that we drive out of our comfort zone. And I will choose in the future to do roles like this, roles that are not only difficult, but at the same time iconic.Toofaan is out-and-out a Farhan Akhtar movie. A movie about a boxing champ, how did you make place for yourself in it?That is the beauty about Rakeysh sir. Even if it is a biopic, he’ll make sure that every character is important. His treatment to his actors and characters is equal. Ananya is a doctor who has a life of her own. As she has so much pain in her life, she has channelised all the ‘dukh and dard’ in the best possible way, and she believes in giving happiness to all the people who she meets. The way this character is written, it is very balanced, it is really nice. I am sure every Bollywood actress is going to be jealous of me playing Ananya.When we talk about other actors being jealous of you, you have already achieved with the projects you have done. Before Toofaan, Super 30 with Hrithik Roshan was a superhit too, and your next is Jersey with Shahid Kapoor. Not many newcomers get these kind of films.I want to be known as a versatile actress, and there is only one thing that keeps ringing in my head and that is that I don’t want to repeat myself. I don’t want to do something that I’ve already done. I want to be a part of a story which is good, irrespective of whatever time I get on screen. Most of the times actresses do have an inhibition about not playing a mother or a sister, and only playing roles where the actress is presented in a very glamorous way. I don’t have such inhibitions as an actor. I realised that the character is very important.I want the younger generation of people who want to be actors to watch my movies and learn from them. I wish I could be at least 2% of what Waheeda (Rahman) ji is or what Madhubala was. That’s the basic agenda.When I walk on the street, I want them to know me as Ananya or Supriya, and not as Mrunal. I want people to know me for my work.Toofaan, featuring Mrunal Thakur, Farhan Akhtar, Paresh Rawal, Supriya Pathak and Vijay Raaz will stream on Amazon Prime Video from July 16."

The actor plays a boxing champion Aziz Ali in the film, who rises from the ashes, not once but twice. Farhan once again impressed his fans with not just his physical transformation but also manages to pack the right punches. The tale of redemption has been directed by Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra, and also stars Mrunal Thakur, Paresh Rawal and Supriya Pathak.Before you stream Toofaan on Amazon Prime Video on Friday, here are eight films on boxing that you must watch. Sorted for the weekend, aren’t you?RockyThe sports drama starred Sylvester Stallone in the titular role of Rocky, which continues to be an alternate identity for the star. The ‘rags-to-riches’ drama projected the story of Rocky Balboa, an Italian-American street fighter who gets a shot at the world heavyweight championship. The 1976 film was followed by Rocky II (1979), Rocky III (1982), Rocky IV (1985), Rocky V (1990), Rocky Balboa (2006), Creed (2015), Creed II (2018), and Creed III (2022). Apart from playing the lead, ‘The Italian Stallion’ as Sylvester was popularly called wrote six films and even directed four of the six titular installments.Mary KomPriyanka Chopra surprised the world when she got into the avatar of India’s most successful boxer Mary Kom. While the makers were criticised for casting a star and using prosthetics to make her look like Mary Kom, Priyanka’s performance shut them all. The actor underwent extensive training for months to attain a muscular physique and even learned the sport to match the boxing champ’s Kom’s distinct style. The Omung Kumar directorial is also ranked among the highest-grossing Indian films led by a female actor.MukkabaazThe Anurag Kashyap directed film starred Vineet Kumar Singh and marked the debut of Zoya Hussain. It even premiered in the Special Presentations section at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival and released internationally with the title The Brawler. Not many know that Vineet wrote the film with his sister Mukti, based on their observations of several sportspersons’ experiences in the country. After being rejected by many production houses, Anurag took up the project but put a condition that Vineet would have to become a real boxer. To complete his task, he went to the Netaji Subhas National Institute of Sports and trained in boxing for a year. The film won accolades from critics and masses alike.AliThe 2001 film, starring Will Smith, focuses on acclaimed boxer Muhammad Ali’s life from 1964 to 1974. The film chronicled Ali capturing the heavyweight title from Sonny Liston and then being banished, only to return to fight Joe Frazier in 1971. The Michael Mann directorial also focussed on how Cassius Clay Jr became Ali after his conversion to Islam, reclaiming the title from George Foreman in the Rumble in the Jungle fight of 1974.PailwaanThe Sudeep starrer 2019 film was initially planned to release in nine languages but later settled for five. The film follows the journey of an orphan who goes on to become a wrestler and a boxer while getting into brawls with those who disrupt his personal life. Playing a pro-wrestler Pailwan Kichcha, Sudeep impressed masses with his physique and action-packed stunts. The film also marked the debut of TV actor Aakanksha Singh.Saala KhadoosThe 2016 Tamil-Hindi bilingual film written and directed by Sudha Kongara, starred R. Madhavan as a coach to Ritika Singh, who played an aspiring boxer. It was reported that Madhavan suffered a minor injury on the sets during the last schedule but continued to shoot through the pain. He even wore metal braces to have a lisp that most boxers have from injuries. The story of redemption was remade in Telugu as Guru with Venkatesh stepping into Madhavan’s shoes.Raging BullThe 1980 biopic stars Robert De Niro as Jake LaMotta, an Italian-American middleweight boxer, whose self-destructive and obsessive rage, destroyed his personal and professional life. Director Martin Scorsese was said to be initially apprehensive about developing the film but later came to relate to the boxer’s story. Considered one of the greatest films ever made, Raging Bull gained critical acclaim, and continues to be a favourite among sports-movie lovers.Cinderella ManAnother iconic biographical sports drama, the film brought to life the story of James J. Braddock, who was nicknamed ‘Cindrella Man’. Directed by Ron Howard, it starred Russell Crowe, Renée Zellweger and Paul Giamatti.

The lyrics are not anything extraordinary, while music has Anu Malik written all over it. While Meezaan’s chiseled body is on full display, Pranitha tries her best to ooze sensuality. Their chemistry does look promising in the romantic track.In fact, one of the segments remind us of Akshay Kumar-Katrina Kaif starrer song “Gale Lag Ja” from De Dana Dan, with a nod to “Tip Tip Barsa Paani” too. “Chinta Na Kar” has been composed by Anu Malik and sung by Nakash Aziz and Neeti Mohan.Hungama 2 is the second part of Priyadarshan’s 2003 hit film Hungama. The only connecting link between both the movies is the director along with Paresh Rawal. Actors like Meezaan Jafri, Pranitha Subhash, Shilpa Shetty, and Ashutosh Rana have now joined the cast.Hungama 2’s first song “Chura Ke Dil Mera 2.0” released earlier this month and went onto grab attention for its recreation of Shilpa Shetty‘s original from Main Khiladi Tu Anari.

After discharge, she had trouble breathing. On Nupur’s insistence, she went to see a doctor. Due to her condition, she was immediately admitted and put on oxygen support.“The last few months, I had been in constant touch with her and hence she developed an emotional bond. As of now, I am trying my best to be around her. However, she needs immediate funds as the hospital might discharge her if we cannot pay them,” Nupur told indianexpress.com.Doctors have advised the senior actor not to strain her vocal chords.In an earlier interview with ETimes, Savita had shared how there are no facilities for senior artistes who face age-related health issues. She said, “I want someone to build an old age home for actors like me who are on their own. I don’t have my own home in Mumbai even after working for so many years.

He guides everyone so well, that I don’t see anything going wrong. When you do something with all purity and honesty, it shows on screen. I hope people feel it has been done well,” she said.The film, produced by Bhushan Kumar’s T-Series, went on floors earlier this year.Sanon, who has shot considerable portions for the film, said it was a delight to work with Raut, Prabhas and Khan- all her first time collaborators.“Everyone is amazing, warm and so correct for the part. I shot with Prabhas at the beginning of my schedule. My next schedule was with Saif. Both are quite different personalities but extremely entertaining in their own way.”Adipurush is also Sanon’s most VFX-heavy film till date and the actor said filming it—with blue screen, chroma—has been a “different experience.”The actor will be next seen in Mimi, scheduled to be released on Jio Cinema and Netflix on July 30."
